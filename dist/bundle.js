Eventhough this is not quite the right place to post my findings, I believe thereare enough of you who'll be interested to justify it. All of the <br>following can<br>be found on the Info-Mac archives:<br> <br>   - GrabAudio. This application grabs audio from a CD and stores it as a     System 7 sound file. Some bugs.<br> <br>   - SoundApp. Does audio file conversion. Formats include AIFF, .WAV, NeXT,     System 7, and more. Also captures off CD if you have QuickTime <br>installed.<br>     Very nice.<br> <br>   - SoundEffects. Very promissing sample editor from Italy. Nice interface,     Lots of features (specially for $15.00) uses plug-in effects. You can     request info to write your own effects.<br> <br>   - SoundHack. Just that, but it has some very tweaked out DSP capabilities     such as convolution and phase vocoding. Requires FPU.<br>  <br> - OutOfPhase. Interesting program that lets you define instruments and<br>     a score to generate music. It has its own instrument definition language     and such. Similar to CSound, but with a much nicer interface, and<br>     not as powerful.<br> <br>   - MidiScope. Great application from Kurzweil. It analyzes and displays     MIDI stream data in hex, symbolic, and graphical formats.<br> <br>   - CSound. Mac version of the old UNIX classic. Very powerful music<br>programmin<br>     language. Not for beginners.<br> <br>   Well, it looks like you can do quite a bit of sound manipulation right onyour Mac without going out and spending megabucks on professional audio<br>software (don't get me wrong; I still think TurboSynth is the hottest pieceof software on Earth.)

Sonic Seasonings released in 1972 prior to<br>>  Eno's ambient works was the double album piece in mind. Although Eno<br>>  used the word &#34;ambient&#34; in the title the liner notes to Wendy's work<br>>  say:  <br>> <br>[snip!]<br>> <br>>  So Weny's album came out first, was ambient, was said to be designed<br>>  to be &#34;decor&#34; and was a &#34;sonic ambience&#34; and pre-dated ENO. BTW ENO<br>>  had to be aware of Carlo's work when he recorded his- I've never seen<br>>  an interview where he was asked but I can't imagine him not being since<br>>  Carlo's album was quite popular in its time...<br>> <br>I agree, SS is a great record, but one thing I do *not* want to see on <br>this list is a squabble about &#34;who gets the credit&#34; for ambient music, or the name &#34;ambient&#34;, or whatever.  Fripp & Eno's &#34;The Heavenly Music <br>Corporation&#34; was recorded in 1972 also, not to mention the earlier works of Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream (1970-1), and even if those works <br>aren't precisely ambient, let's just think carefully before committing <br>ourselves to disentangling the strands of progressive, ambient, <br>electronic, minimal, and musique concrete, and assigning credit for the invention of each.  <br><br>After all, as you imply with your deliberate inclusion of the term <br>&#34;electronic&#34;, the idea of spatial and timbral qualities taking compositional precedence over melodic and harmonic ones goes back at least to Edgard <br>Varese in the 20's and 30's - back when electronics were just a gleam in his eye (and let's not get started on the theremin or ondes <br>martenots!!).<br><br>But anyway, the point is well taken about Eno's alleged &#34;invention&#34;, and welcome to the group!<br><br>D.<br><br>P.S.

I've been an electronic musician since 1978 and VERY<br> interested in the creation of ambience in all its forms - faster toon's too but ambience has a special place in my heart....<br><br> A comment about its start ( in electronic's form ) Of late I've noticed that Eno is most always mentioned as the &#34;originator&#34; of the electronic ambient music but personally I've always assigned that &#34;honor&#34; to<br> Wendy (then Walter) Carlos. Sonic Seasonings released in 1972 prior to<br> Eno's ambient works was the double album piece in mind. Although Eno<br> used the word &#34;ambient&#34; in the title the liner notes to Wendy's work<br> say:  <br><br> &#34; It is an aural tapestry, created by the imagination and expertise of<br> Walter Carlos, from impressionistic and expressionistic experiences of<br> Nature..... We have manipulated these sounds - electronically orchestrated them, so to speak- into an amalgam of the natural and the synthetic....<br> .... But on the level of pure enjoyment, these records were designed to be a part of the decor, so to speak - a sonic AMBIENCE that embraces the listener's total environment.....<br><br><br> So Weny's album came out first, was ambient, was said to be designed<br> to be &#34;decor&#34; and was a &#34;sonic ambience&#34; and pre-dated ENO. BTW ENO<br> had to be aware of Carlo's work when he recorded his- I've never seen<br> an interview where he was asked but I can't imagine him not being since Carlo's album was quite popular in its time...<br><br> And lastly it's a wonderful album and the recording techniques used <br> &#34;almost quad&#34; hold up as SOTA even today. Now if the release had been<br> remastered into CD - I only have the original double album.<br><br> Just my $.02 - maybe someone has already mentioned it ? If not it might be useful for a FAQ or history of the movement...<br><br><br> Again - great to see the list ! thanks for the initiative and WORK!<br><br> <br> Many thanks,<br><br> Mike Clay (Star Zeit)<br><br><br> PS What is the BEST &#34;posting&#34; address for the list ?<br> <br> ambient@hyperreal.com ? <br> ambient-owner@hyperreal.com ?<br> <br><br>------- End of Forwarded Message<br><br>"},amb_1994_09_128:{subject:"Ntone",from:"Mad Gil <cyberpun@wam.umd.edu>",dateString:"Sat, 24 Sep 1994 13:42:44 -0400 (EDT)",content:"<br>I had never heard of this label, but the other week I wasking the guy at the record store what was good, and he suggested Hex Antistatic on this label.<br>It's interesting.

The two works both end with the same 3-5-2, 3-5-2, 3-5-2,3-1 modal line but the later work takes structures from the original as<br>basis for the underpinning ostinati. Likewise, the original &#34;Prinsengracht&#34;is performed by extracting melodic fragments from &#34;interferences&#34; in a <br>prerecorded tape of multitracked ostinato patterns. So &#34;Prinsengracht<br>Extensions&#34; is something akin to a &#34;generation loss&#34; process from the initial&#34;Prinsengracht&#34; background source...hence the title; it is an &#34;extension&#34;of the extraction process, this time extracting initial background materialfrom the confluence of the foreground _and_ background figures of a priorwork. Although the work _appears_ to have its roots in minimalism (due tothe predominance of repetitive cellular figures), the actual genesis of theimprovisation/performance process used in it comes instead from the middle-period works of Karlheinz Stockhausen, in particular &#34;Kurzwellen&#34;, <br>&#34;Prozession&#34;, or &#34;Spiral&#34;.<br>\tAs for the initial inspiration for the work, it comes from a trip<br>in 1987 with the Middle TN State University Chamber Choir to London and Amsterdam. On the day we were to leave Amsterdam to return to the USA, Itook an early AM walk down the Prinsengracht, which our hotel was locatedon, to a nearby tobacconist's to get some clove cigs. On the way back, Ipaused on a bridge over the canal and watched as the sun began to break thruone of the typical icy fogs (this was in early March), and listen to the ringing of the Westermarkt Church bells about two blocks away as they bouncedoff of the buildings along the canal. &#34;Prinsengracht&#34;'s initial ostinatocell pitches are derived from patterns I heard that morning, with an attemptto both emulate and augment the echo patterns I heard. This work was <br>performed several times in the Nashville area in 1987 and 1988 by myself andsound projectionist Jim Irwin, performing as &#34;LVXUS&#34;. When Jim died of AIDSin December of last year, I later conceived of &#34;Prinsengracht Extensions&#34; as something of a memorial to both him and his great assistance to my work while I was in the Nashville area from 1980-88, and it's dedicated to his memory.<br><br><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\\ &#34;We have come to the edge of a world whichD.A.C.

In addition, <br>shrink-wrapped applications like Spry's Internet in a Box, Mosaic <br>Communication's Mozilla, and more will make getting online so simple my cat could do it.  Not to hold AOL up as an example of anything, but they are conduction tests of delivery of content over coaxial cables, which <br>could carry up to 10 megabits/second.<br><br>> The computing hardware might exist, but for<br>> someone who worried about corporate co-option in you last post, DOG, you're<br>> bring damned short-sighted here. Who's going to pipe all of this amazing<br>> digital entertainment into our hyper-mondolated PCs? Corporations. Big ones,<br>> in fact. Not little things like Fax or Instinct or whatever, but big<br>> monolithic things like Sony, AT&T, or Viacom. <br><br>Who says the guys providing the pipes are also providing the water?  That'sonly true in non-switched data stream formats - cable or broadcast TV,<br>newspapers, etc.  This is why video-on-demand is a failed concept from thevery beginning - the companies involved are still in the<br>I'm-the-producer-you're-the-consumer model.  There can be - there *has* to be- a sharp division between content providers and network providers.  No<br>matter who gives you a pipe to the net, you can access the same services. Some worry that the big guys are going to create their own parallel switchednetwork using proprietary protocols where they don't have to worry about&#34;nettiquette&#34; and which will subsume the Internet we know; some say <br>that's what this &#34;National Information Infrastructure&#34; is all about.  <br>That's a bunch of malarky too.<br><br>I think all forms of artistic expression will be altered by this, just astechnology always has given the artist new tools to create.  Works involvingmanipulation of &#34;found art&#34;, collaborative works (not two or three, but<br>dozens, hundreds, thousands of people involved), genetic algorithms, and morewill find a home.  You can already see manifestations of that on some of themore interesting WWW pages out there.  What happens when music stops beingrock-star-to-screaming-fan, and starts being peer to peer?  &#34;Hi Ritchie,here's my layer of sounds on your new Plastikman track - see what you<br>think...&#34;  What happens when people can interact with music encoded not asone continuous stream of 44.1khtz 16-bit sound, but as separate tracks theycan tweak and customize, and *share*?  The role of the artist, in some<br>situations, will move from being raw producer of totally original music toinformation filter.  I mean, that's what DJ's are right now!  Only the DJ's&#34;records&#34;  will stop being slabs of vinyl and be data streams - and thus canbe whole songs, layers of songs, samples from songs, visual data associatedwith songs, and more.  It's not a question of hardware - that's coming and isin many situations already here, it's a question of building the software todo this and getting people to create with them.  I think ambient music, including sister genres like whatever you'd call the genre that <br>Negativland is and more adventurous forms of dance music like Orbital, <br>will be the real beneficiaries here.  <br><br>At least, that's the kind of system I'm building.  :)<br><br>\tBrian<br><br>"},amb_1994_10_164:{subject:"fwd - Commercial and that.../Grrr...",from:"Andrew Thomas <athomas@hydra.acs.uci.edu>",dateString:"Sat, 15 Oct 94 12:56:12 -0700",content:"<br><br>------- Forwarded Message<br>Date: Fri, 14 Oct 1994 18:21:15 -0700 (PDT)<br>From: Interstellar Groovy Dave <camde933@goshawk.csrv.uidaho.edu><br>Subject: Commercial and that...<br>To: Mixmaster Morris <morris@space.demon.co.uk><br>Cc: ambient@hyperreal.com<br><br>>         enigma are to ambient music<br>>         what 2 untalented are to techno<br>\tWell, I must admit, that Enigma had some lovely tracks.

Perhaps if there is any geardiscussion, it be kept light with &#34;Gear&#34; in the heading making it easy todelete for those not interested. What if Eno posted to the list? Would you askHIM not to discuss gear? A prime example is the 3 speaker method that Enorecommends on the back cover (see vinyl) of &#34;Discreet Music&#34;. That would be adiscussion of speakers and wiring which ultimately results in the ambientexperience that Eno had intended, which becomes part of the music. I will agreethat much of the discussion on this list (gear) is not nearly as groundbreakingas Eno's, but we're still new here. How about some listening recommendations(not CD's) from the gear people on manipulation (sound) or wiring to get a (forexample) different listening environment or creative speaker placement...Full speed and limited.

I agree with Lin that surround sound, or spatialization, can increase the ambient effect.<br><br>It appears that quite a few CD's are using some spatialization technology like the Roland RSS, Hughes SRS, Q Sound, B.A.S.E. or binaural mic'ing to enhance that sence of being inside the music. The first four processes <br>suffer from sweet spot dependency (you have to be right at the apex of an equilateral triangle with the loudspeakers at the base points for best <br>effects to be heard.) The binaural mic technique is often accompanied by the dreaded &#34;front/back reversal&#34; - a listener experiences an ambiguous directionality for sounds that originate directly in front of, or in back of the binaural head michrophone.<br><br>There is a technology just around the corner though that will enable <br>robust spatialization of audio images - the new digital, discrete channel surround processes which will be migrating from the cinema exhibition <br>world to the home in the next year or so.<br><br>Currently, in the cinema there are three principle digital surround <br>systems - Dolby's, Sony's and DTS's (funded in part by Universal Studios) and all three companies are working on non-compatible consumer versions of their pro products. Here comes VHS vs Beta again...<br><br>Anyway, once the dust settles I'm sure more producers and lables will be looking to release ambient music recorded in a discrete multichannel <br>digital format - and create soundscapes with a greater sense of depth <br>than current two channel stereo or even matrix surround can offer. <br><br>That just leaves height information missing to create true 3D <br>soundscapes...perhaps height info can be matrixed onto the discrete <br>lateral info...<br><br>In the meantime, try listening to your ambient tracks thru a surround <br>sound system and if you're in the Boston area listen to some original <br>surround sound mixes on &#34;ElectricSpace&#34; - Tues 12:30 to 2:30am on WMBR 88.1<br>regards<br><br>Michael Joly<br>soundman mj on &#34;ElectricSpace&#34;<br>"},amb_1994_09_195:{subject:"Re: Dougans or Cobain?",from:"Brother Alphabet <jah10@Ra.MsState.Edu>",dateString:"Thu, 29 Sep 1994 22:07:41 -0500 (CDT)",content:"<br><br><br>OH...so now were all supposed to give a shit who the mystery 'DOG' is...<br>goody.<br><br><br><br>This has been a message from : Jason A.

TE<br>To: ambient@HYPERREAL.COM<br>Subject: Re: 99% have no chance<br>Sender: owner-ambient@HYPERREAL.COM<br><br><br><br>> I think both are missing the point. High-quality recording and<br>> reproduction is much more important to electronic music (of almost any<br>> genre) than music based on acoustic instruments. When you listen to a<br>> recording of a saxophonist, it doesn't matter if the recording is perfect<br>> or not, because you recognise the instrument and your brain fills in the<br>> gaps to rebuild the sound image.<br><br>Come on!!! Do you _know_ any saxophonists ? Do you really think that<br>they all sound exactly the same ?  The sometimes tiny nuances that are<br>only reproduced on quality equipment are vitally important to define<br>an individual's style.<br><br>However, that point is just to refute any discrimination between acousticand electronic instruments.  I'd say that the acoustic if anything are<br>more important.  As for hi-fi, well the average maniac who has gone out<br>and bought the top flight gold plated mega system would be quite horrifiedto see the sort of connections the music went through at source....<br><br>The thing is that the musician looses control of the music once it has<br>been recorded.  This debate about equipment doesn't even consider the<br>differences between the essential item of equipment we all use - our<br>ears.  Who can say if a particular sound is the same for person A and<br>person B ? The whole thing is irretrievably subjective, as is describingmusic with words. There is as much interaction between the listener and<br>the music as there is between the musician and the music, and my feelingis that the mark of a really succesful musician is the knack of being<br>able to include enough possibilities with the parameters of the compositionto stimulate the listener into becoming a part of the process. One<br>oustanding example of someone who succeeds in this is Eno.  Music X on<br>a $200 system is not worse than on a $20000, just different, and (probably)further away from the sound in the studio. But one thing is certain -<br>nobody will _ever_ hear it exactly as the musician heard it at the time<br>it was recorded, and it's futile to try.<br>"},amb_1994_08_11:{subject:"test and heylow",from:"Andrew Thomas <athomas@hydra.acs.uci.edu>",dateString:"Tue, 23 Aug 94 22:56:50 -0700",content:"<br><br>------- Forwarded Message<br>From: Steve J White <aragorn@csd.uwm.edu><br>Subject: test and heylow<br>To: ambient@hyperreal.com (ambient)<br>Date: Tue, 23 Aug 1994 21:53:17 -0500 (CDT)<br><br>I guess this is mainly a test to see if my sub took, but also to say hi toeveryone on the list.

Out of my 55 CD's I can see approximately 5 or so thatare &#34;dodgy.&#34;. FAX has released at least 35 very good to fantastic CD's (lowestimate). The Air and Silence CD's are absolute masterpeices. Someone pleasename me more than 5 FAX CD's that aren't any good.....and don't say it isn'tgood because you don't like the style because that's not really fair. Thereare alot of different styles on FAX, not just ambient.

Atleast ZYX are paying the COPYRIGHT SOCIETY, what this Mr. Kuhlmann avoids to do(which is, frankly spoken: a crime). Besides, he uses a fake LC-number (whichis, as the appropriate German society GVL told me, also a crime).<br><br>[Ooooo! I'm sure this will cause a few comments to fly on the AMBIENT list!]<br>ZYX is Germany's biggest independent record label. In the first quarter of 1994they are on the German Single-CD market the number Two. On the (longplay) CDmarket they are the number Eleven. (Numbers 12 and followings are: Intercord,RCA, Geffen, Arista, Harvest, Dance Pool, Capitol, Hansa, Urban, Blow Up,Polydor, Atlanta, Arcade etc.). Their turnover in 1992 was 60 million DM, in1993 it was 130 million DM. They have their own mastering studio, their owndesign studio and printer, their own pressing factory, a huge classical<br>department, their own salesmen, they do the same silly mistakes as the biglabels... and-so-on. After all, I wouldn't say it is an &#34;obscure&#34; label. Theyare HUGE!<br><br>The correct American address of ZYX is:  ZYX MUSIC DISTRIBUTION LTD<br>                                         72 Otis St.<br>                                         West Babylon, NY 11704 USA<br>                                         phone: 001-516-253-0800<br>                                         fax: 001-516-253-0128<br><br>All this does not mean that I have a special liking for ZYX.

Why should he change?<br><br>WALLACE WINFREY: This very first Baffo Banfi LP with a sentence by KS on thecover was offered like SOUR BEER during the eighties. This could be because thelabel was a &#34;Free Jazz&#34; label. My record dealer offered me plenty of copiesof GALAXIE MY DEAR for 3 DM a piece, just to get rid of them. I took three (incase of), and he granted them to me. Baffo was our tour guide during 1975'sSwiss and Italian gigs. Later he did two solo LPs on our IC label. He was anice and very funny Italian, but we never heard from him after approximately1982.<br><br>ANDREW HALEY: I don't know, if - or if not - I will underline Andrew's words,that KS &#34;has spent the last 25 years trying to achieve this&#34;, when I reportthat Klaus and Herr Kuhlmann did the recording in question on just one weekend.A loose session, that's all.<br><br>(personal remark: it took me a while to get the meaning of FSOL).<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>So there you have it folks.

But this all<br>by no means indicates that &#34;AMBIENT IS DEAD&#34;, as you put it. I'm more<br>inclined to think that what's going on really is more indicative of a <br>lot of people exploring some new boundaries as far as music goes. Some ofthese explorations, by default, are not going to work. Some, however, likeFSOL's &#34;Lifeforms&#34;, hit considerably closer to the mark. But the fact thatoff-wack ambient is getting produced doesn't mean that the whole genre<br>is invalidated.<br>\tTo me, the whole ambient direction (and please note...this does<br>not just include the ambient techno spectrum; there is a lot more to<br>ambient than FSOL, Aphex Twin, and Pete Namlook) represents some real<br>searching for new sounds, new ways of dealing with tone, time, spatial<br>dimension, and a host of other issues that other less-exploratory musicalforms are not as well equipped to probe. The fact that ambient is such afertile meeting-ground for artists from such diverse directions as techno,New Music, industrial, rock, classical, jazz, and so on is adequate proofof not only this point, but of the fact that ambient is becoming (has<br>become?) a new neutral-ground for musical development, sort of an<br>electronic or computer-age version of the meeting-ground that spawned<br>jazz back around the turn of the century from blues, brass-band music,<br>folk, and popular songs. With such a melting-pot of actions, concepts,<br>directions, and so on, it could also be conceivable that another reason<br>for the perception of invalid activity is because there are no clear<br>signposts pointing the way for those who feel a desperate _need_ for<br>signposts.<br><br>> But more than there music they have elevated themselves above the pack and<br>> this is because they managed to create a beleievable world (the graphics<br>> the video work and the music and media reviews) they seem to live and speak<br>> a new form of communication (there use of ISDN and silicon graphics)why<br>> can't other electronic artists be more dynamic.Unless more thought and<br>> energy is injected into this scene it will IT WILL<br>> IMPLODE*********************<br><br>I think there's plenty of _creative_ energy being injected into ambient<br>from what I've been seeing over the past couple of years.

I think also youmight be better served by broadening your attention as far as ambient isconcerned, and checking out some of its touch-points with other musical<br>directions. Artists such as Harold Budd, Alvin Curran, Carl Stone, Laraaji,the Eno bros., Terry Riley, Klaus Schulze, Nurse With Wound, Thomas Koner,and indigenous musics of Indonesia, the Balkans, and several other<br>cultures _all_ have a place in ambient music...and have little or no<br>connection to ambient techno.

Most of the music on this album falls comfortably within the current parameters of &#34;ambient&#34;, which is probably the genre I've drawn the most inspiration from over the last year or so.  Influences apparent here & there include David Sylvian, Jim O'Rourke, the &#34;Baraka&#34; soundtrack, and Prof. Eno.  (I've also been told that one of the tracks is reminiscent of the Aphex Twin, but I haven't heard enough of his music to agree or disagree with that.)I also have a self-released cassette, &#34;Compromise&#34;, which is very ambient, in the mode of Robert Fripp and David Sylvian (separately).  Information is available from the address below.  (End of shameless self-promotion.)<br><br>I'm always on the lookout for new sources of information on new music, so I'm glad to have found this list.  I think what I like the most about <br>ambient music is its variety, and that it seems to be where the most <br>adventurous forms of musical exploration are taking place. My latest <br>acquisitions include two releases from Les Disques VICTO, Henry Kaiser/Jim O'Rourke's &#34;Tomorrow knows where you live&#34;, and <br>Kaiser/Kimura/O'Rourke/Oswald's &#34;Acoustics&#34;.  I'm also partial to Eno's instrumental albums, Jeff Greinke, Robert Fripp, David Sylvian, Michael Brook, Black Tape For A Blue Girl, The KLF (who, as we all know, have now left the building), and The Orb, plus I'm a recent convert to FSOL and <br>(recent) Cabaret Voltaire.<br><br><br>Now, if something could be done about all the generic samplers that are beginning to appear...<br><br>Kevin<br><br>Kevin J.

Silence definately was a more quiet (hence the title)album and isn't much like many other titles Fax has put out. Try listening toany of the Air ,Sequential, or Alien Community releases. They have much moretextural content and dance beats that take it out of the background category.<br>If you do want to hear the best of Fax records, I would reccomend listeningto &#34;The Definative Ambient Collection&#34; Vols 1&2 released on Rising High<br>Records. This really does live up to its billing and has much of the bestwork from Fax. Get either one; they're both excellent.<br><br>I also picked up a recording of a live show Namlook did in San Francisco, andfound that to be quite incredible as well, and anything but silent. It wasmostly a continuous percussion track with intermitant breaks of keyboardnoises. But, instead of just discounting this as mere &#34;swooshy&#34; stuff, it isinteresting to judge the piece on its dynamics. It ranges from fairly heavypercussion, to more quiet, sometimes eerie synthesizer noises and vocals.Very droning and cool.<br><br>One last word on the Silent release: the track &#34;Santur&#34; off this album, whichalso appears on the Ambiento compilation, is a departure from the minimalistkeyboard sound of the other tracks, and has a quite cool Middle Eastern<br>percussion and melodic sound. This undoubtedly was the work of Dr. Atmo, thecollaborator with Namlook, who also puts out material under the name SadWorld.<br><br>Anyways, I hope people don't take anomolies and try to label the ambienttechno scene as a whole. There is so to much good stuff coming out that it isridiculous (and driving me broke). I have mentioned at least 6 releases thatare stupendous, and I haven't scratched the surface of all the excellentmaterial (like Beumond Hannant, Bandulu, Higher Intelligence Agency, SeeFeel,Global Communications, Autochre, + many others) that is available. And, likeMixmaster morris said, the scene is still exploding. This music still hasways to go before it is dead.

So you get this instead:<br><br>TOP TEN AMBIENT ALBUMS THAT I'VE RECEIVED RECENTLY IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER OF PREFERENCE<br>(I've deliberately tried to avoid mentioning stuff that everyone else has already featured)<br><br>1.   Various Artists - Document 01: Trance / Tribal (Dorobo, Australia)<br>Not strictly &#34;ambient&#34;, but I'm sure most ambient fans would enjoy this collection of (mostly) obscure bands enormously; it varies from hi-speed trance techno to abstract strangeness and ethnic forgeries.<br><br>2.   Various Artists - Ambient 4: Isolationism (Virgin, UK, double CD)<br>Absolutely indispensable collection of cold techno, post-industrial <br>ambience and unfriendly experimentalism; AMM next to Aphex Twin, Disco <br>Inferno next to Kazuyuki Null, Zoviet France meet Seefeel; an instant <br>classic.<br><br>3.   Various Artists - Mind The Gap (Staalplaat, Netherlands)<br>Featuring Revolutionary Dub Warriors, Zoviet France, O Yuki Conjugate, <br>Horizon 222, Rapoon, Nocturnal Emissions and more, this is another <br>crossover effort, blending &#34;traditional ambient&#34; music with <br>post-industrial, dance-based, ethnic and experimental sounds.<br><br>4.   Various Artists - Twilight Earth (Timebase, Germany)<br>Featuring O.Y.C., Paul Schuetze, Vidna Obmana, Steve Roach, Hybryds, Jeff Greinke, Tuu and plenty more; genuine Fourth World music as pioneered by Eno and Hassell, ethnic ambience from most of the genre's best known <br>names.<br><br>5.   Organum - Submission (Complacency, USA)<br>New release from David Jackman, lots of the usual flute, bowed cymbals <br>and unidentifiable drones. Organum releases are few and far between, <br>more's the pity.<br><br>6.   Zone - The Divine Simplicity (Potentia / World Serpent, UK)<br>A little-known Welsh duo who combine ambient, post-industrial and ritual sounds. This new album has less of the chanting and percussion of before, and at some point gets surprisingly noisy, but it's an interesting <br>attempt to create a spiritual experience without resorting to (too many) cliches.<br><br>7.   Rapoon - Vernal Crossing (Staalplaat, Netherlands)<br>I didn't like their previous album, Raising Earthly Spirits, but prefer this; it's been described as industrial raga, and that's a fair <br>description. Suitably hypnotic.<br><br>8.   Osso Exotico - Musica #1 (Korm Plastics / Staalplaat, Netherlands)<br>Could be pigeonholed as minimalist rather than ambient, since this <br>follows in the tradition of LaMonte Young and similar drone pioneers. A single long composition blending tonal and microtonal instruments to <br>create lots of interesting harmonic effects; despite a rather flimsy <br>structure I like it a lot.<br><br>9.   Tony Conrad - Slapping Pythagoras (Table of the Elements, USA)<br>Likewise minimalist, Conrad has worked with LaMonte Young, Velvet <br>Underground and Faust. This hasn't actually been released yet (due any <br>day, though), but I'm looking forward to Conrad's violin drones so much that I had to include it.<br><br>10.  Phill Niblock - A Young Person's Guide To ... (Blast First, UK, <br>double CD)<br>Likewise due any day, and likewise associated with the drone-minimalists, and likewise a purveyor of fine harmonics, albeit with a wider variety of instruments. Live, his music is ambient in a real sense in that <br>overlapping sound waves ensure a different sound depending on where you sit/stand in relation to the speakers.<br><br>This post is already too long, so that lot will have to do for now...<br><br>[OnNow: computer hum and voices of people from across the room]<br><br>Brian Duguid                 BD1@mm-croy.mottmac.co.uk<br>182 Cavendish Road - Balham - London - SW12 0DA - U.K.<br><br>"},amb_1994_10_44:{subject:"Haruomi Hosono",from:"mr808@teleport.com",dateString:"Tue, 11 Oct 1994 07:17:22 +0000",content:"<br>I recently picked up two new Haruomi Hosono albums (three if you includeTechnodon).

A few of the tracks do have vocals, butthey're very mellow - one w/ a women singing in Japanese I found very<br>trancey.  Instrumentation varies from the synths & samplers you'd expectfrom a YMO alumnus to traditional instruments like guitar & koto.  Laraajimakes a guest appearance (remember Ambient 3?).  Overall it's a very mellowalbum, but I really don't know what to compare it with.  I'd say this ismore for hardcore YMO fans.<br><br>Mental Sports Mixes - this CD clocks at 50+ minutes, 8 tracks.  This discis more of an &#34;ambience for techno boffins&#34; release.  It's all remixes, bythe Orb, Graham Massey (808State if you don't already know), Tim Simeononfrom Bomb the Bass, and Something Wonderful (Japanese).  The Orb mix fitsin w/ the stuff on Live 93, and they demonstrate what great FX Box playersthey are.  The 3 Graham Massey mixes are much better than anything on<br>Georgeous (gee, I wish he'd change record labels so he could quit doing<br>poppy shit).

The shows are called THRONE OF DRONES and RE-IMMERSION.  If you <br>saw the Mixmaster Morris/Spacetime Continuum presentation last spring, <br>then <br>these will be a great follow-up.<br><br>Both shows are being presented by SOUND TRAFFIC CONTROL, a bay area-based <br>media arts organization that specializes in a real-time, interactive <br>audio <br>system through which musicians, engineers, conductors, vocalists, DJ's, and <br>sound sculpture installations blend into an interwoven surround sound <br>orchestra.  This system is a 3D spatial sound reinforcement network that projects music and audio events everywhere throughout the room even more insanely than the THX audio array used in many films.  &#34;Sound Traffic <br>Control&#34; is a sonic metaphor: the operators of the 3D surround hub are <br>like <br>air traffic controllers whose Midi transmissions guide musical airborne &#34;cargo ships&#34; from different parts of the sound world by separate and <br>simultaneous &#34;taxis,&#34; &#34;takeoffs,&#34; and &#34;landings.&#34;  The audience members are <br>spectators who roam the &#34;runways,&#34; intersecting with various musical <br>trajectories.<br><br>The Thursday night show, THRONE OF DRONES, features the ISO-AMBIENT <br>ORCHESTRA, a collective of local instrumentalists from numerous bands and <br>solo projects whose live remote appearance is akin to an internet style of <br>live communication.  Members include Joe Gore, Jonah Sharpe, Chris Muir, Robert Rich, Miguel from Single Cell Orchestra, Michael Belfer from <br>Torcher, Anton Newcombe from Brian Jonestown Massacre and Larry LaLonde from Primus.  Also on the bill is David Darling, solo cellist, whose <br>evocative, melancholy music will provide a deeply atmospheric mood.  <br>Those <br>familiar with his CD releases on the ECM and Hearts of Space labels <br>should <br>witness his inauguration into the 3D sound field.  Along with this <br>arrives <br>the  Acid Karaoke of Carl Stone and the oriental singer Mien Xiao-Fen.  Carl is an internationally known electronic music composer who has <br>traveled <br>extensively and released many wild and whimsical works for New Albion and <br>other labels.  His music in combination with Mien Xiao Fen's exotic <br>vocals <br>should transform the event into a department-store frenzy.  DJ's for the night are not your usual fare.  Ethnic world specialist Cheb i Sabbah <br>will <br>mix a multi-layered tribal/space environment.  Jonah Sharpe of Spacetime Continuum is back from England with a fresh new collection of tracks.  <br>Finally, debuting on digital transport will be the creator, coordinator and <br>curator of Sound Traffic Control, Naut Humon.  The show begins at 9 p.m. and costs $6.<br><br>Friday's RE-IMMERSION, presented in conjunction with Ambient Jungle, adds a <br>festive element.  Appearing with Sound Traffic Control will be Spacetime Continuum, a techno-ambient convergence from the Astralwerks label.  This <br>is guided by Jonah Sharpe, whose aural exploits include collaborations <br>with <br>Bill Laswell, Peter Namlook, and Deep Space Network.  The evening's lift-off will be provided by Reflective Records' Single Cell Orchestra, who <br>explore the mysterious underside of the ambient phenomenon through <br>chromatic transpositions and narrative form.  For those who continue to dance, DJ's Mark Farina, Thomas and Felix will spin atypical house and <br>techno beats in the Dubzone.  Macross Vision by Hyperdelic will fill the Dubzone with synaesthetic color and light.  Re-Immersion begins at <br>midnight <br>and costs $10.<br><br>On both nights, the 3D sonic habitat will be punctuated by Perry <br>Hoberman's <br>Symphonic Appliance System, which triggers household goods including <br>projectors, radios, and garage tools in an audio/visual atomic-age <br>setting.<br><br>Concurrent to the shows will be the Audio Engineering Society (AES) <br>convention for pro audio gearheads at the Moscone Center in San <br>Francisco.  <br>Those looking for futuristic audio technology in an alternate location <br>need <br>look no further. The Sound Traffic Control Level Control System runs <br>multiple Macintosh workstations live to discreet DSP mixer posts which <br>are <br>dispersed to a loudspeaker matrix.<br><br>          FOR MORE INFORMATION, CALL 415.522.7380<br><br><br><br>-- <br>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<br>   J   E   S   S   I   C   A       G   R   A   C   E        W   I   N   G <br><br>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ &#34;ART IS DEAD; I AM A NECROPHILIAC&#34; <br>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br><br>-!-<br> !

My name is Kendall, and I help to DJ an electronic<br>music radio show on KRCL 91 FM community radio in Salt<br>Lake City, Utah, USA.  Our show (&#34;Variables - 2 & 1/2 hours<br>of mostly electronic music,&#34; Sunday nights from 10:30p to<br>1:00a) has been around for over 10 years now.  In the past,<br>we have played the more popular electronic works from<br>artists like Tangerine Dream, Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis,<br>Kraftwerk, etc., as well as lesser-known artists (as much as<br>we can get our hands on).  We have also played<br>electronic works from a few fantastic unpublished local<br>artists.<br><br>This show has a sort of mellow feel to it.  That's not to say<br>that we don't play fast, energetic music (we often do), but we<br>do avoid playing the more hardcore, sharp-edged music.  We<br>also avoid what is commonly known as &#34;new age&#34; music -<br>the show that airs before us plays that stuff.  Oh, and we<br>also avoid the light jazz or &#34;adult contemporary&#34; that<br>sometimes passes as &#34;new age.&#34;  We tend to avoid music<br>with lyrics for the most part.<br><br>Lately, a lot of music has been coming into the station that<br>is &#34;ambient electronic,&#34; &#34;techno,&#34; &#34;trance,&#34; etc.  Much of is<br>mellow synthesizer music, ranging from the most ambient,<br>&#34;sonic wallpaper&#34;-type stuff thru fast-paced intelligent dance<br>music.  You know - the latest stuff from Orb and other groups<br>too numerous to mention.<br><br>We are very interested in giving this new electronic music the<br>airtime it deserves.  Unfortunately for us, most of it ends up<br>in the &#34;rock&#34; section of the station's library before we get a<br>chance to see or hear it. <br><br>Since we are not very familiar with the ambient/techno scene<br>yet, we have no idea where to look in the library for discs that<br>we could play.  Since it is all mixed in with the rock discs,<br>it's a hit-and-miss, trial and error method for us right now.  I<br>can look there for an hour and come up with maybe 3 discs<br>worthy of our show.<br><br>Could you people recommend some ambient/techno albums<br>that fit the description of our show? (name the album and the<br>artist - our library is in pseudo-alphabetical order).  Hopefully,<br>we can learn enough to help us distinguish in the future what<br>to look for.  Meanwhile, maybe we can talk to staff about<br>setting up a new area specifically for ambient/techno/idm<br>music.<br><br>Thanks all,<br><br>Kendall Jackman<br><br><br>"},amb_1994_11_212:{subject:'Rob\'t Rich "Propagation" -- disappointed',from:'"Jens Alfke" <jens_alfke@powertalk.apple.com>',dateString:"21 Nov 1994 17:38:22 -0800",content:"<br>Remember when I was asking for Robert Rich recommendations?

We are not able to processforeign cheques or converting currencies other than L and $ and are <br>intending to<br>set up credit card facilities in the near future.<br><br> We shall accept orders immediately and send out CDs (only) when pressed(for the 3 current titles) or at the official release date for forthcomingtitles.

From the swirling majesty of &#34;Reynardine&#34; to the true<br>dronitude of &#34;Matty Groves&#34; (which starts off as two chords and<br>resolves to one) this one's for the ages.  Stark, otherworldly, etc.<br> <br>The Velvet Underground, The Velvet Underground (the third album) -<br>More folk-rock, but with fabulous, essential stuff like &#34;What Goes<br>On&#34;, with it's fantastic guitar drone that set an example for a<br>generation.  All VU albums are great.<br> <br>Mike Oldfield, Hergest Ridge - Tubular Bells set the tone, but HR is<br>simpler, gentler and far more listenable in the long run.  Dense<br>--More--(43%)<br>sounds, utterly simple music.<br> <br>Brian Eno, Music For Airports - One of the few albums by a &#34;pop<br>theorist&#34; that's actually any good.  Highly listenable at any level of<br>attention.<br> <br>Richard and Linda Thompson, Pour Down Like Silver - borderline drone,<br>but on the basis of &#34;Night Comes In&#34;, &#34;Dimming of the Day&#34; and even<br>some of the straightforward songs, there's a droney, otherworldly<br>quality that seems to send me to the same place as other classics of<br>the genre.<br> <br>Spacemen 3, The Perfect Prescription - Perfect is right.  A gentle<br>breeze that sometimes turns into a firey inferno and comes right back.<br>A genuinely spiritual album, with thoughtful lyrics and a deep<br>emotional resonance.  Perhaps one of the finest manifestos on the<br>pleasures and perils of drug use, but you don't need drugs to enjoy<br>it (they've taken them for you!).  Eclectic in all the right ways<br>(going from the serene nirvana of &#34;Feels So Good&#34; to the swirling hell<br>of &#34;Things Won't Be the Same&#34; is inspired and doesn't seem merely<br>snotty).  It's an album that rewards extensive listening.  I didn't<br>really notice the very final lines of the song &#34;Walking With Jesus&#34;<br>until about the 30th listen (it's deep in the mix, but audible).<br> <br>Spacemen 3, Playing With Fire - Who'd have thought it possible?  One<br>year later, and an album that's almost as good as PP, but totally<br>different!  This album's tone is even more overtly spiritual and<br>confessional, but none the less confrontational in its intent.  It's<br>more &#34;difficult&#34; listening than PP, but over time, it reveals itself<br>as accesible.  It's fitting that this album should feature the<br>Spacemen at both their prettiest (&#34;Come Down Softly to My Soul&#34;,<br>&#34;Honey&#34;) and their most harsh and atonal (&#34;Revolution&#34;, &#34;Suicide&#34;).<br> <br>Galaxie 500, This is Our Music - All three Galaxie albums are<br>essential, but this is my favorite.  Every song is a winner, from the<br>goofy charm of the opening (&#34;I wrote a poem on a dog biscuit, but the<br>dog refused to look at it, so I got drunk and watched the Empire<br>State Building.  It was no bigger than a nickle&#34;) to the Beatlesque<br>sweeetness of &#34;King of Spain Part 2&#34;.  Dean's guitar never sounded<br>better, Damon's drumming is ace, and Naomi, the true soul of the band,<br>is in tip-top form both in her melodic, trebly bass-playing and her<br>gorgeous vocals on &#34;Listen the Snow is Falling&#34;.<br> <br>The Darkside, All That Noise - Some might argue that this record,<br>though great, is simply TOO close a pastiche of the classic<br>psychedelic era.  But there's a lot more than ust that.  &#34;Waiting For<br>the Angels&#34; is quite &#34;modern&#34; sounding, and a scorcher at that.  I<br>also like that when they're derivative, they're very obvious about it,<br>as in &#34;Soul Deep&#34; (which has entirely &#34;found&#34; lyrics I think - can<br>anyone name them all?) rather than the coy appropriation of say, The<br>Charlatans.  This album is just dripping with atmosphere, a kind<br>of smoky, rainy-night, smelling of bourbon and marijuana and cheap<br>floozies in London or Las Vegas.<br> <br>Spiritualized, Lazer Guided Melodies - How sweet it is.  Jason adds<br>horns and strings, tightens up the sound (Spiritualized is more like a<br>chamber ensemble than a rock group, really!) and produces a full, rich<br>sound that envelopes and embraces you.<br> <br>Spectrum, Soul Kiss (Glide Divine) - More warmth and love from Sonic<br>Boom.  Sonic has found new sounds and a more &#34;mature&#34; compositional<br>style, and it works a charm.  At times the record is almost &#34;new age&#34;,<br>but what new age album would have a drug/ecstasy anthem like &#34;How You<br>Satisfy Me&#34; on it?  Yanni and Kitaro run screaming.  Sonic has never<br>forgotten that great squalling feedback is still a component of this<br>sort of thing.<br> <br>Damon and Naomi, More Sad Hits - Maybe it's just because it's new, but<br>I think this is a classic in the field, and feels tantalizingly like a<br>fourth Galaxie 500 album.  I've raved about it before, but the song<br>&#34;This Car Climbed Mt.

Eventually, one becomes very aware of the sonic space(s) inwhich the work occurs, the slightest changes of timbre, volume in each sound,the overall flow of lines and forms, and so on. It's also very akin to beingin a form of a trance state, or very deep meditation.

Here's my attempt at a review:<br><br>Never mind the distortion - Nav Katze (Invitation/Victor VICL-568, 3,000 yen)1. Nobody home (Ultramarine mix) - remixed by Ultramarine<br>2. Ziggy (Aphex Twin mix #1) - remixed by Aphex Twin<br>3. Never not (Black Dog mix #1) - remixed by Black Dog Productions<br>4. Crazy dream (retro 313 future memory mix) - remixed by Reload<br>5. Change (Aphex Twin mix #2) - remixed by Aphex Twin<br>6. More than a feeling (Black Dog mix #2) - remixed by Black Dog Productions7. Wild horse (Global Mix Communication) - remixed by Global Communication<br>total playing time - 53:40<br><br>Overall, this is a very good album, though to refer to it as a &#34;remix album&#34; is something of an understatement.  Most of the tracks bear very little resemblance to the original versions; only the first and third tracks keep any substantial part of the vocals (the rest contain a few wordless samples here and there), and very few of the original instrumental tracks are <br>retained.  In that sense, this album resembles the YMO remix album that came out a year or two ago.<br><br>Most of the new mixes could probably be best described as pop-techno.  That is, techno, yes, but nothing hardcore - no need to worry about speaker <br>damage from heavy bass.  The Aphex Twin remixes are the weakest of the bunch - their intentionally &#34;dirty&#34; sound quality doesn't work against them; they just don't sound much different from other Aphex Twin tracks I've heard (none of which I've really liked).  Particlarly irritating are the pinging sounds that run throughout both tracks.<br><br>The two Black Dog mixes are both very similarly constructed to each other, but work very well (especially since they both follow Aphex Twin mixes).  Lots of space.  I especially like the various percussion used. I guarantee, though, that &#34;More than a feeling&#34; will be unrecognizable to just about everyone - it doesn't even sound like the remake of which it is a remix (figure that one out).<br><br>The Reload remix is probably the hardest track on the album.  Part of it sounds to me like Tangerine Dream gone techno.<br><br>The Ultramarine mix works the best, I think.  It has a bit of a light reggae feel to it - or at least it feels as though that's where it really wants to go. It also keeps much of the original vocal tracks, thereby putting the song in a fresh new setting.<br><br>The Global Communication mix is the most ambient track on the album, <br>creating a swiriling, blissed-out atmosphere for the first two-thirds of its 15 minutes and 15 seconds.  The beats come in around one-third of the way through, and provide the focal point for the about the last five minutes of the track.<br><br>Unfortunately, I've never heard anything by the artists who remixed these tracks (except for Aphex Twin - I don't listen to much ambient techno), so I don't really know how they compare to these artists' own records.  Still, I do know that I like these tracks, and I would recommend this album to <br>others.  And, since most of these tracks don't sound much like their <br>original versions, even folks who might not like Nav Katze themselves would probably like this.

Very soothing, and tranceful. &#34;Mind The Gap&#34; samples what Iassume to be a voice in a train station telling passengers to &#34;mind the<br>gap&#34;. This sample gets annoying after a while, but luckily it's used<br>intermittently. Train sounds politely brush up to the forefront, and thendrift backwards. Meanwhile, a very icy drone lays the backdrop for the<br>entire piece. It whispers, growing louder, and then receding again. I foundthe effect of the droning sounds to be hypnotic when played at loud levels.&#34;The Flickering Flame&#34; is a short piece that is much louder than the<br>predecessors. Somewhat disjointed, with various sounds popping in and out.<br>  &#34;Transparency #3&#34; is ambitious. Once again, ambient droning soundscapeslay the backdrop and various bell sounds, and other ringing percussion<br>filters in and out.

It reminds me of Vol 1 in the series, which<br>I didn't like that much (even though I myself had contributed), more<br>than Vol 2, which is a shame.  Floaty stuff with very little to hook<br>onto.

This is a wild, amazing trip into realms<br>hitherto left unexplored by ambient creators.  Spacy and electronic,<br>with deep FSOL-esque synth blasts wrapped around almost jazzy acoustic<br>sounding stuff.  There's some upright bass and flute parts that sound<br>real.  Probably are, for all I know.  Great melodies, great rhythms<br>from time to time.  I love it.  Also don't miss their track Wild<br>Spirit Of Song, on Ambient Dub Volume 3 - easily the highlight of that<br>album.<br><br>This disc leaves me full of optimism - it's not cliched or hackneyed<br>in the least.  It manages to be very electronic yet still retain a<br>human touch.  A joy from start to end.<br><br><br>Tangerine Dream: &#34;Tangents&#34;<br>Virgin CDBOX 4<br><br>Tangerine Dream were always quite prolific, and this box set showcases<br>their most productive and creatively successful periods - the Virgin<br>Records era, 1973-1983.  It's five CDs worth of original tracks,<br>recreated versions of old tracks, soundtracks and previously<br>unreleased material all wrapped in a stunning Buggy G.<br>Riphead-designed box.  Obviously something that covers such a wide<br>range will have wildly variable contents, but I personally find about<br>75% of the material to be worthwhile, which is a very respectable<br>ratio.  If you've already got all the Virgin CDs, this might be<br>redundant, but for someone like me who was looking for a good way to<br>replace a lot of worn vinyl, this is a great deal.  An ideal present<br>for the space music fan in your life.<br><br>Oh, and if you've never checked out the Dream, this is a pretty decent<br>introduction.  My one complaint is that it misses off some of the<br>really trancy synth pieces (like &#34;Thru Metamorphic Rocks&#34;) in favor of<br>more melodic material, but we can't have everything...<br><br>Jon Drukman                                                 jsd@cyborganic.com------------------------------------------------------------------------------Things are more like they are now than they ever were before.<br>"},amb_1994_09_57:{subject:"Tetsu Inoue",from:"terremt@mail.med.cornell.edu (Terre Thaemlitz)",dateString:"Mon, 19 Sep 1994 15:41:14 -0400",content:"<br>>From: gamshad@tcs.com (Mohsen Gamshad)<br>><br>>My listening list these days:<br>><br>>1) Tetsu Inue:   Ambient Otaku (FAX)<br><br>sp:      [Inoue] [Ambiant]<br>            ^         ^<br><br>This cd is currently at the top of my list as well (which doesn't get<br>changed that often).

Back to the future, let's go!<br><br>TP: Why don't you start by telling me about your new album, called <br>76:14 [their debut, out on Dedicated Records]?  Did you have an idea, <br>like a theme behind it or a particular concept that you wanted to get <br>across?<br><br>TM: Yeah, it's called 76:14 because we basically did away with a <br>name for the album and names for the tracks because names tend to <br>predefine what something's going to be about and the whole concept <br>of the album is something to let the listeners use their imagination.  <br>They can make up their own names for the tracks.  They listen to the <br>music and sort of generate their own images in their head, conjure <br>up things.  We're translating our emotions and feelings into the music <br>and telling little stories with the tracks.  <br><br>TP: You did name the one track on the album, Obselon Mi-Nos?<br><br>TM: Yeah, that's correct.  That's actually quite an old track now, it <br>was done a year and a half ago.  We put that out on our record label, <br>Evolution Records and that was sort of the thing that most people <br>heard about Global Communication from, that one track.<br><br>TP: I think in this country, most people have heard of you because of <br>the Chapterhouse remixes [Pentamerous Metamorphosis] so if you <br>want to talk about those a little bit: how you connected with the <br>band.<br><br>TM: I met up with Andy and Simon from Chapterhouse last summer <br>and it was right about the time their new album was coming out.  <br>They approached us and they liked the Obselon Mi-Nos track.  They <br>asked us if we'd like to treat their album, just like a retranslation.  So the idea was, we sat down and listened to the tracks with them, <br>listened to all of the subliminal sounds in the background, talked to <br>them about what the point or the meaning of each track or song was, <br>and basically did a retranslation, not a remix.  We have to stress that it's a retranslation, because remix in the traditional sense of the word is something completely different.  What we did was take the <br>meaning and the emotion from the original tracks and retranslate it <br>in the Global Communication way, which is heightening the whole <br>emotional experience.  <br><br>TP: You're also known as Reload, and you put out a full length <br>entitled A Collection of Short Stories.  Can you tell me, is there a <br>marked difference between Global Communication and Reload since <br>it is the two of you in both projects?<br><br>TM: The main difference is, it's basically like a yin and yang thing.  If you think about human beings, there's two different major aspects to <br>human beings and that is like a dark side and a light side.  Good and <br>bad, white and black, that kind of thing.  Global Communication is <br>like the lighter side of human nature, the sort of more uplifting and <br>positive emotions.  Reload is more dark and sinister, things people <br>don't like to think about.  <br><br>TP: Well, I think we're out of time, I have one more question, it's for my friend.

Isuspect that some of the samples came from Fripp's back catalogue, as I<br>can't find them on the album.  I'm not sure that the &#34;4 on the floor kickdrum&#34; crowd will be able to dance to this one, but take my advice - crankup the bass and it will be very danceable (at least to a DeadHead).<br><br>If you're an FSOL, Fripp, or Sylvian fan, I'd consider this a &#34;must buy&#34;.I'd suggest buying it on Virgin's &#34;A Brief History of Ambient III&#34; - it'smuch easier to find than the 12&#34;, and you get over 140 minutes of music forabout $20.  (The first three volumes of this series look like a<br>representative sampling of my record collection).<br><br>I'd like to thank Fripp for staying fresh and making a concerted effort towork with people outside of his usual circle - the Orb, Thomas Fehlmann,the Grid, FSOL.  What I like about Fripp is 1) He has a unique style of<br>playing the electric guitar which is NOT blues based like 98% of the geetarwankers out there, 2) He really has three unique styles/sounds - his<br>Frippertronics style, his fast plectrum playing style, and his feedback<br>style.  What's best is you'll never figure out who his influences were fromlistening to his playing.  3) He's a very efficient dish washer.  How manyother Rawk Stars do you know that will do their own laundry as well as<br>other people's dishes.  A very PRESENT person.<br><br>Remember, there have been Ambient sections on all of Fripp's albums goingback to '69's (?) &#34;Court of the Crimson King&#34;.  Fripp's one of the Ambientpioneers, and still on the cutting edge.

Thisparticularly affects synthesists who are trying to emulate traditional music( not usually a good idea, more like a budget problem ). The problem forsynthesists not trying to emulate traditional sounds is that their listenersare brainwashed into expecting traditional sounds and are culturally trainedto translate those sounds into emotion.

Naturally, I snatched it (with trembling hands), ran to <br>          the cashier, and, to his annoyance, forked out the ton of ten           franc coins that have been accumulating over the course of my           last few trips to Europe. But enough of that. The music <br>          itself: a strange mix. I can't recall track titles, but the <br>          first track blew me away. It opens with all knds of crazy <br>          orchestral blasts and then moves smoothly into a moderately <br>          fast housey groove with some great low-frequency snappy <br>          sounds. Things sort of stay the same for a while, and then we           have a mid-tempo technopop song that would've sounded outdated           even in the late 80s. Ick. For the most part, the songs lack <br>          the fabulous melodies that are Schulze's trademark, and focus           instead on rapid staccato bursts of clever noises. The song <br>          with the Alphaville singer is frankly awful--he sounds <br>          simultaneously mortifed and constipated--but then I hadn't <br>          expected differently. There are, however, a few really slow <br>          and spaced out tracks that are very pretty and hypnotic. In <br>          sum: not a flop, but not a hit either, &#34;Trancelation&#34; sounds a           bit too clever ad not passionate enough; similar, in many <br>          ways, to the Elektric Musik (ex Kraftwerk) album. I'd love to           hear the next Wahnfried project, though--there are certainly <br>          lots of interesting ideas here. Surprising output, at any <br>          rate, for an old fogey like Schulze. Cool that he's <br>          collaborating with Namlook, too.<br>          <br>          Christopher Franke &#34;Klemania&#34;: I also got this used in Paris,           and I'm glad I did, because I found out after getting back to           the States that it's a limited-edition mail-order only <br>          release. The only other Franke solo I'd heard was the Live CD,           which I quite liked, although it did get a bit annoyingly <br>          syrupy in places. &#34;Klemania&#34; consists of two really long <br>          tracks and one short one. The first one begins, believe it or           not, with a fast 5-minute rave-fest. Shocking! (in a nice <br>          way!) I'd always thought that Franke was more in the <br>          electronic prog-rock camp than in the ambient/techno scene, <br>          and it was great to hear this guy overloading his synths and <br>          drum machines with some really charged techno. Things then get           much mellower, and we're treated to a variety of <br>          sequencer-driven and exceedingly pretty drifting synth <br>          workouts. Very nice. The album is still a bit too sugary in <br>          places for me, both in terms of melody and texture, but I <br>          really *like* (as opposed to having a clinical interest in) <br>          this CD. It's warm, intricate and has quite a few tricks up <br>          its sleeve. It's on Franke's Sonic Images label--they may <br>          still have copies available.<br>          <br>          That's it for now--I've picked up quite a few other <br>          interesting space-music/ambient-related things (Todd Fletcher           &#34;Byzantium&#34;, Manuel Gottsching &#34;E2-E4&#34;--amazing--was this <br>          truly recorded in '81?!) and some more, but I'm out of <br>          time...)<br>          <br>          Help needed: Could someone post the number for Noteworthy?

By example to use tribal music on fat edited sequences, or use David Hykes choirs on devotees chanting is, I think, a mess.<br><br>From ambient-owner  Wed Nov  2 15:46:30 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id PAA06495; Wed, 2 Nov 1994 15:46:30 -0800Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id PAA06487; Wed, 2 Nov 1994 15:46:24 -0800From: &#34;Chris.Hilker&#34; <cspot@hyperreal.com><br>Message-Id: <199411022346.PAA06487@taz.hyperreal.com><br>Subject: Re: Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies<br>To: ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Date: Wed, 2 Nov 1994 15:46:23 -0800 (PST)<br>In-Reply-To: <9411021657.AA24744@arctic.owlnet.rice.edu> from &#34;Darryl Stephen Roy&#34; at Nov 2, 94 10:57:47 amX-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4 PL23]<br>Content-Type: text<br>Content-Length: 462       <br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br>>Although they appear on the Eno-L archives (where I just discovered them) I<br>>thought that there would be a definite interest here...Oblique Strategies is<br>>a set of instructions written on flash cards that Eno consults in the studio.<br>For those of you who use Macintoshes, a Hypercard version of the Oblique Strategies deck is available (in MacBinary II format):<br><br>ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/cspot/ObliqueStrategies.bin<br><br>C.<br><br>-- <br>(Chris.Hilker) cspot@hyperreal.com<br><br>From ambient-owner  Wed Nov  2 17:15:36 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id RAA10388; Wed, 2 Nov 1994 17:15:36 -0800Received: from vxc.ocis.uncwil.edu by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) with SMTP id RAA10383; Wed, 2 Nov 1994 17:15:30 -0800From: DLN5423@VXC.OCIS.UNCWIL.EDU<br>Received: from VXC.OCIS.UNCWIL.EDU by VXC.OCIS.UNCWIL.EDU (PMDF #7214 ) id <01HJ0L31BFAO90MV1C@VXC.OCIS.UNCWIL.EDU>; Wed, 2 Nov 1994 20:15:48 EST<br>Date: 02 Nov 1994 20:15:47 -0500 (EST)<br>Subject: comp. of suggestions<br>To: ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Message-id: <01HJ0L31BOXU90MV1C@VXC.OCIS.UNCWIL.EDU><br>X-VMS-To: IN%&#34;ambient@hyperreal.com&#34;<br>MIME-version: 1.0<br>Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII<br>Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT<br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br>i asked for suggestions of mid-eastern and tribal(african) ambient and i gotsome really good ideas and i compiled them for ya'll.<br><br>Mid-eastern ideas:<br>Muslimgauze<br>Passion-Peter Gabriel: i have this and it's really great, it's music from the \t\t       &#34;Last Temptation of JC&#34; and other inspired tracks.<br>Material-Hallucination Engine: great album and i already have it.

The best description I can give is &#34;The Orb remix <br>Michael Stearns&#34; (or perhaps vice-versa? :-) ).  I had not previously <br>picked this up because of a review which characterized it as being quiet with not much going on.  I found this not to be the case.  Although it <br>sounds very little like Aphex Twin, it does have one thing in common, <br>which is the ability to be very minimal, but nevertheless have a lot going on, especially melodically; ie minimal, but not at all random.  (Often <br>minimalist ambient works tend to have lots of seemingly random noises with little to connect them.)<br><br>So, how similar/different is &#34;Reload - Short Stories&#34;?<br><br><br>PS I also received &#34;My Bloody Valentine - Loveless&#34;.  This seems a little overrated.  For those who haven't heard this, it's sort of Cocteau Twins plus wall-of-sound-noisy-guitar (the latter in sort of a Black Sabbath or perhaps more accurately a Sonic Youth style).  The songs don't have any memorable aspects - mostly because it is difficult to discern anything <br>that one could hang a memory on.  To me the appeal must be, &#34;gee what an interesting combination of elements&#34;.  But I'd rather listen to Cocteau Twins, Black Sabbath, and Sonic Youth separately....<br><br>-<br><br>respect to all,<br><br>Ken            ken@snowcrest.net   (primary address)<br>               (if no answer, try ken.stuart@tigerteam.org )<br><br>From ambient-owner  Thu Nov  3 00:48:26 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id AAA22876; Thu, 3 Nov 1994 00:48:26 -0800Received: from mail02.mail.aol.com by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) with SMTP id AAA22871; Thu, 3 Nov 1994 00:48:23 -0800From: Imaja@aol.com<br>Received: by mail02.mail.aol.com<br>\t(1.38.193.5/16.2) id AA14766; Thu, 3 Nov 1994 03:47:55 -0500<br>Date: Thu, 3 Nov 1994 03:47:55 -0500<br>Message-Id: <9411030053278138354@aol.com><br>To: ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Subject: Re: Baraka Soundtrack<br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br>> The soundtrack was done by a multitude of people and unfortunately I can't<br>> remember them, except for Dead Can Dance with Lisa Gerrard getting an<br>> extra thank you at the end, as well.<br><br>What kind of music is Dead Can Dance?

I still think the movie hadmore impact than Koyanisquatsi.  The music seems to have more feeling andsomewhat of a connection to the fantastic imagery. I would love to see aremake of the film with the original sounds, but then it starts to become asimpler travelogue/documentary of these amazing places. If I weren't so poorI might travel to some of these places myself.  Airplanes create tons ofpollution and are resource guzzling, inefficient people movers. Traveling tosee these amazing places seems to go against the message the film conveys ofhuman greed against nature.

Mix those Bulgarian women with 1990s Sheila Chandra, and you'll get a relatively close idea of the singing style of Lisa Gerrard, the female in Dead Can Dance.  (DCD has always had a <br>number of supplementary musicians, but Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry <br>have been the core for 15 years.)  Lisa Gerrard's songs tend to be <br>composed of made-up Arabic- or Indian-sounding words, though she does <br>come out with real languages once in a while.  The actual words aren't <br>nearly as important (to her or to us) as the profoundly moving effect of her voice.<br><br>Brendan Perry seems like more of a traditionalist.  His vocals show more of the Joy Division influences, as well as more of the Celtic influence, especially on recent recordings.  But he also often plays an important <br>role in many of the more exotic songs.<br><br>If you liked _Baraka_, you should like _Toward The Within_, the new live video (and film?) put together by the same guy who made _Baraka_.  The terrific soundtrack that goes with this is also widely available now.  If you <br>want a comprehensive introduction to DCD, try to find the Ryko <br>compilation, _A Passage In Time_.  For a really good album in DCD's <br>early-to-middle period, try _Within The Realm of A Dying Sun_.  Then <br>there's their recent, more accessible (yet more Eastern-influenced) <br>release, _Into The Labyrinth_.

WHAT CULTURE?<br>><br>><br>><br>>The niche appeal of today's dance music suggests that a pop culture<br>>which united the young has never existed. DAVID BREARLEY argues that<br>>the death of the three-minute pop song is a serious threat to some of<br>>the most powerful institutions of our time.<br>><br>>  Every generation struggles with it's children's music. Fortysomethings<br>>had a problem with Elvis in the 50's, with the Rolling Stones in the 60's,<br>>and with the Sex Pistols in the 70's. But today's music is a giant<br>>headache for all except the very, very young: anyone over 25 is likely<br>>to feel alienated.<br>><br>>  The difference between Elvis, the Stones and the Pistols, and what is<br>>happening today, is enormous - evolution in the first case, revolution<br>>in the second. The modern dance sound represents a complete reassessment<br>>of western musical principles and reflects a profound change in its<br>>audience. Pop is well and truly dead - as a style of music, as a way<br>>of thinking, and as a system of indentification.<br>><br>>  When parents first heard Elvis and said 'It's not music', all they<br>>really meant was : 'It's loud, it's crude and I don't like the way that<br>>young man moves his hips.' When they heard the Stones and said 'It's not<br>>music', all they really meant was: 'It's noisy, it's lewd and I don't like<br>>the way that young man moves his lips.' When they heard the Pistols and<br>>said the same thing, all they really meant was: 'Those people can't even<br>>play, and I don't like that young man.'<br>><br>><br>>  But when today's parents hear techno or hip hop and say 'It's not music',<br>>they mean exactly that. And in certain vital respects they're right,<br>>because much of what we understand to be music is absent - junked,<br>>dismissed by the young dance composers as an irrelevance.<br>><br>><br>>  Think of beat music - rock, rock 'n' roll', rockabilly, blues, country,<br>>Mowtown, soul, funk, bubblegum, psychedelia, surf, glam, disco, punk,<br>>thrash, new wave, new romantic..the lot - as a combination of two elements:<br>>the backbeat and the 12-note tonal system. These were the pillars of any<br>>Sex Pistols song, as surely as they were the foundation of the most<br>>complex opus by, say, Led Zepplin or Queen.<br>><br>><br>>  Not any more. The dance movement, or at least the progressive wing of<br>>it, has freed itself of the 12-note tonal system. In doing so it has<br>>rejected a glorious repertoire that stretches back at least to Bach<br>>and a theory which Pythagoras helped develop two-and-a-half millennia<br>>ago. Tune as we know it is gone, and harmony with it, All that remains<br>>is the beat: 20 hertz, 120 times a minute - that's the prescription.<br>>The sound of the 90's, a bloody loud kickdrum, is so hypnotic it acts<br>>as a giant safety net, accommodating any other sound imaginable.<br>>Pantonality has arrived. All sound, pitched or unpitched, has become<br>>music.<br>><br>><br>>  Hip hop by the likes of Public Enemy has no tune and therefore offers<br>>none of the comfort and reassurance we expect from beat music. Without<br>>a tonal system, the songs cannot resolve themselves; changes from<br>>verse to chorus, where they still exist, are not signposted; the point<br>>at which a song begins and ends becomes arbitrary. It's a new headspace.<br>>Ears are either born to it, retuned or obsolete.<br>><br>><br>>  This is problematic stuff. The death of the three-minute pop song, and<br>>the erosion of the entire pop mentality, is a serious threat to some of the<br>>most powerful institutions of our time. Our best active songwriters, pop<br>>craftsmen such as Neil Finn, are finding it harder to address young people<br>>than their forebears did only a decade ago. Obviously, anyone with a<br>>product to sell and a young market in mind - from sitcom scripters to<br>>soft-drink manufacturers - has to come to terms with the new headspace.<br>><br>><br>>  The first step is to admit it exists. The six major record companies,<br>>the ones with the most to lose, are fighting a desperate rearguard action<br>>against change, using nostalgia as their weapon. The number one album in<br>>this country for 1992 was 'Jesus Christ Superstar' while Michael Crawford's<br>>collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber tunes was number eight. Jimmy Barnes and<br>>The Commitments weighed in at three and 10 respectivley with compilations<br>>of soul standards.Neil Diamond's greatest hits package was the year's<br>>seventh-best seller, Abba's was the 12th, and Queen placed 11th and 16th<br>>with two such offerings. Older record buyers replacing classic vinyl with<br>>compact discs also accounted for a considerable volume of back-catalogue<br>>sales.<br>><br>><br>>  Venues reflect the trend. Entertainment centres in the capital cities<br>>have become museums for pop dinosaurs such as Elton John and Rod Stewart,<br>>while the pub rock circuit is host to a swill of tribute bands dedicated<br>>to replicating the look and sound of old chestnuts like Meatloaf, the Doors<br>>and (of all things) Bad Company. Australia's very own Abba tribute, Bjorn<br>>Again, enjoyed such heady success in Scandinavia last year it is rumoured<br>>the members of the real thing are considering a reunion...<br>><br>><br>>  All this belies the fact that the new music - 'tuneless' dance music<br>>has a strong and growing following. Rap, in which the tonal relationship<br>>between vocal and instrumental is completely broken down, is no longer<br>>an exclusively black phenomenon. The charts are full of it.<br>><br>><br>>  Public Enemy,whose message is aggressively at repressed black Americans,<br>>have played to a huge Australian audiences twice in the past five years.<br>>Their music is a collage in which sirens, wails and scratches take<br>>precedence over traditional instruments, and sounds are mixed by intuition<br>>rather than according to a recognized tonal system.<br>><br>><br>>  Single dance parties attract tens of thousands through DJ's and designers<br>>whose role is to set a mood and maintain it, create a trance atmosphere,<br>>avoid the series of stops and starts, fast songs and slow that we associate<br>>with rock concerts and radio formats. The tune is not altogether extinct<br>>-<br>>you'll still hear a little Kylie or Madonna at the bigger dance parties -<br>>but it's fast becoming so.Techno raves feature music that would make<br>>little sense to, say, Paul McCartney, much less to composers of earlier<br>>generations and much less again to casual listeners.<br>><br>><br>>  Almost independent of the mass media, the dance movement is a healthy<br>>and complex beast with its own networks, subcultures and sub-subcultures.<br>>Asking some kids if they like dance music is as about as square as asking<br>>if they like pop. 'Which' dance music? House? Deep house, Italo house, diva<br>>house? Acid? Techno? Hardcore? Trance, Breakbeat, Belgian, Detroit? Dub<br>>reggae? 'Which dance music'?<br>><br>><br>>  The divisions prove dance has become far more than a fad, and they<br>>present a dilemma for the record companies. Niche markets are notoriously<br>>hard to attack from a global perspective.<br>><br>><br>>  It's not hard to argue that pop music had run it's course by 1970. It's<br>>signature instrument, the guitar, had already reached its limits in the<br>>hands of Jimi Hendrix. Mowtown had elevated pop songwriting to a level of<br>>sophistication never seen since. The major movements had established<br>>themselves; all that remained was for second-generation rockers to combine<br>>and cross-pollinate existing styles.<br>><br>><br>>  Punk was an admission that rock was out of steam, but far from being the<br>>revolution, it was hijacked and sold off as a commodity. Punk musicians<br>>played the same instruments, used the same chords, sometimes even sang the<br>>same songs as their predecessors. Their revolution was all attitude and<br>>no substance; five years later the mainstream was lamer than ever.<br>><br>><br>>  Dance, a real revolution in purely musical terms, exposes punk for the<br>>false promise it was. The record companies don't understand it as music<br>>or as a product. They don't know how to exploit it. The music played at<br>>raves is pressed on vinyl, at least half of it in extremely limited<br>>editions. Moreover, those pressings are not the finished product - it's<br>>what the DJ does with them, how he mixes them and what he overdubs that<br>>counts. Then follows the tricky issue of context; the music is designed<br>>to be played at high volume in unseated arenas under spectacular lights<br>>and - here's the ugly bit - on a headful of drugs. There's not much point<br>>buying a copy to play in your bedroom after school.<br>><br>><br>>  Clearly, dance says pop is dead as music. It also says pop is dead as<br>>a set of beliefs. Radical shifts in art reflect radical shifts in society,<br>>and the appeal of dance music is symptomatic of a rejection of pop values<br>>that were thrust on young people four decades ago.<br>><br>><br>>  There was a time earlier this century when teenagers had no identity,<br>>meaning they had no money. When they finally established themselves as<br>>a financial force certain false assumptions were made; a market became<br>>a demographic almost overnight. Commercial necessity and the media's<br>>tendency to generalise gave rise to a false teenage profile, the myth<br>>of a vital homogeneous mass untied by common hopes and beliefs - a pop<br>>culture. Critics of today's divided youth speak of those years with great<br>>reverence, recalling a time when everyone was doing the twist, or later<br>>when everyone was dropping acid, when everyone was tuning in, turning on<br>>and dropping out.<br>><br>><br>>  But were they? Or was the pop culture part fantasy? Is it possible that<br>>we are dealing here with the illusion of community rather than community<br>>itself? The Beatles, probably the most conspicuous single embodiment of<br>>pop, played to 10,000 empty seats at Shea Stadium in the summer of 1966;<br>>days later 11 fans greeted them at Seattle airport. Even allowing for John<br>>Lennon's 'bigger than Jesus' remark earlier that year, those are pretty<br>>ordinary turn-outs - hardly the stuff of a united teen movement sharing<br>>a single pop consciousness. Mid-60s footage of Beatles and Stones concerts<br>>shows two seperate audiences, one distinctly younger than the other.<br>><br>><br>>  In popular mythology, Elvis was a rocker and so was Cliff Richard. The<br>>simple truth is they were poles apart - if you pitched them both at<br>>today's youth they'd tell you straight: Elvis had balls and Cliff was a<br>>pussy. But in the late 50s and 60s they were both new phenomena;<br>>teenagers had not yet learned how to dispose of the disposable, and Cliff<br>>somehow found a place in rock history. Today there's no shortage of pap,<br>>but teens and even the mass media have learned to recognize it. Nobody<br>>believes a group such as Girlfriend is of any significance whatsoever.<br>>as for Michael Bolton, the modern equivalent of Cliff Richard, it's<br>>highly unlikely he has a single fan under the age of 25.<br>><br>><br>>  Today's teenage society is infinitely more sophisticated than previous<br>>ones. It has divided and sub-divided into evermore discriminating factions-<br>>niche markets - and with the rejection of specific musical styles comes a<br>>rejection of specific characteristics which were once thought to be<br>>inherently 'pop'. The first of of these is the myth of a united movement.<br>><br>><br>>  I believe there has been a subtle shift in the old &#34;world is good/world<br>>is bad&#34; dichotomy, and that shift has exposed many of the falsehoods that<br>>went with pop. Our happy-endings culture, a cornerstone of the pop ethic<br>>doesn't make as much sense to teenagers as it once did. Youth might have<br>>lived under the threat of Armageddon in the 60s, but at least the danger<br>>was a tangible one. Woodstock represented an age of great optimism, a time<br>>when young people could visualise a carefree, post-nuclear world of their<br>>own making. Well, where is it? The Woodstock generation are now masters<br>>of their own universe, admittedly with a greatly reduced nuclear threat,<br>>but is it the Utopia they expected?<br>><br>><br>>  The most popular song of the post-punk counter-culture, the song voted<br>>to No 1 year after year by 2JJJ listeners, is Joy Division's 'Love Will<br>>Tear Us Apart': &#34;When routine bites hard, And ambitions are low, When<br>>resentment rides high, And emotions won't grow, Love, Love will tear us<br>>apart.&#34; Always in the Top 20 is the Boys Next Door's 'Shivers': &#34;I've<br>>been contemplating suicide...&#34; What is this if not a rejection of the<br>>happy-endings culture? And what is unresolvable music - music which has no<br>>tonal logic, which cannot end in the right chord-if not a rejection of<br>>the happy-endings culture?<br>><br>><br>>  In rejecting the happy ending - or in the case of the dance crowd,<br>>replacing it with a more realistic drive for hedonism - you call into<br>>question at least half the baggage that goes with pop. The very idea<br>>that you can buy a neat little slice of pop and take it home with you<br>>becomes less appropriate.<br>><br>><br>>  So does the star system. In serious dance circles, the people at the<br>>top of the tree are often faceless. The hottest DJ's in the world are<br>>Sasha and Joey Beltram, but can anyone picture them?

By 1908,<br>>Schoenberg had accepted that the notion of a key signature was purely<br>>academic. He dropped it and a large part of the audience dropped him.<br>>Five years later the creme of Parisian society was reduced to spitting<br>>at each other, driven wild by the rhythmic excesses of 'The Rite Of<br>>Spring'. Yet only a year after that, another (younger) Parisian audience<br>>gave Stravinsky a standing ovation for the same work. By 1940, the<br>>greatest of all populists, Walt Disney, considered it a fitting soundtrack<br>>for 'Fantasia'.<br>><br>>  The jury is still out on Schoenberg, but what is now widely accepted<br>>is that he was no knee-jerk reactionary. He was a legitimate product of<br>>his time, his theory was beyond reproach, and his music was a considered<br>>response to the richness and complexity of Wagnerian orchestration.<br>>Nobody, not even his greatest detractor, doubts that he changed 20th<br>>-century music for ever.<br>><br>> Dance music will come to be understood in the same way: problematic,<br>>unpleasant maybe, but legitimate. And in time its most radical elements<br>>will be recognised as progress via tradition. The accent on beat is what<br>>happens when black Americans lean on their African roots, and in the late<br>>20th century it sounds right to young people. Even the idea of sampling,<br>>appropriating slabs of other people's music, is nothing new - Satie<br>>quoted Chopin and Schubert in his own piano pieces.<br>><br>>  For many devotees of orchestral music, Schoenberg represents the<br>>apocalypse; jazz purists strike the same wall with Miles Davis' 'Bitches<br>>Brew'. They expect today's composers to respect earlier traditions to<br>>the letter, and in doing so they limit themselves to a stagnant repertoire.<br>>In 1993, beat music reaches its own Rubicon.<br>><br>><br>><br>>David Brearley writes regularly for The Australian on popular music<br>><br>>Posted without permission<br>><br>>--<br>>James Mc Parlane ( ) God/Emperor- Minimum Safe Distance   ( ) Graphics/Vide=o<br>>Dept of R&D ALIFE X  Voice +(61-2)692-0340; fax 552-6655   X   C/C++ source<br>>   nanoTECHno    ( ) Data  +(61-2)552-6670 to 14.4k 24hrs ( ) PC/AMIGA/NEWT=ON<br>>- Loosely Coupled Super Computing Project - Biological Computing Division -<br>><br>><br>=46uck the past...get ON with the future!<br><br>PEA=C7EOUT<br>MR-808<br><br>Now on Sony: Texturology - Beaumont Hannant<br><br><br><br><br>From ambient-owner  Fri Nov  4 13:49:02 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id NAA20929; Fri, 4 Nov 1994 13:49:02 -0800Received: from ns1.hybrid.com by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) with ESMTP id NAA20920; Fri, 4 Nov 1994 13:48:56 -0800Received: from ops.hybrid.com (opslink.hybrid.com [198.13.11.2]) by ns1.hybrid.com (8.6.9/8.6.9) with SMTP id OAA15847 for <ambient@hyperreal.com>; Fri, 4 Nov 1994 14:01:27 -0800Received: by ops.hybrid.com (4.1/SMI-4.1)<br>\tid AA18213; Fri, 4 Nov 94 13:52:53 PST<br>Date: Fri, 4 Nov 94 13:52:53 PST<br>From: jeff@hybrid.com (Jeff Spirer)<br>Message-Id: <9411042152.AA18213@ops.hybrid.com><br>To: ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Subject: Archive?<br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br>Is there an archive site for the ambient digests? <br><br>Jeff<br><br>From ambient-owner  Fri Nov  4 13:54:19 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id NAA21167; Fri, 4 Nov 1994 13:54:19 -0800Received: from ucssun1.sdsu.edu by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) with ESMTP id NAA21160; Fri, 4 Nov 1994 13:54:14 -0800Received: (zeigler@localhost) by ucssun1.sdsu.edu (8.6.8/8.6.7) id NAA07127 for ambient@hyperreal.com; Fri, 4 Nov 1994 13:54:04 -0800From: Tim Zeigler <zeigler@ucssun1.sdsu.edu><br>Message-Id: <199411042154.NAA07127@ucssun1.sdsu.edu><br>Subject: TUU's latest<br>To: ambient@hyperreal.com (Ambient Mailing List)<br>Date: Fri, 4 Nov 1994 13:54:03 -0800 (PST)<br>X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4 PL21]<br>Content-Type: text<br>Content-Length: 820       <br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br>> Here am I harking on about TUU, when I pop down a nearby store, and what<br>> do I find?

Every worthwhile live<br>>performance I've ever been to succeeded because a genuine interplay was<br>>achieved between performer and audience (or DJ and dancers)... etc. The<br>>capability for interaction beyond a preset script is what makes even a<br>>live-sequenced performance inherently more interesting than a DAT playback.<br>I agree with all of this.  My first question concerning live performance is:<br>How &#34;live&#34; must a performance be a valid performance?  At one extreme youhave total improvisation, at the other you have DAT playback w/ no<br>additions to the original musical material.  Is a performer singing over abacking DAT valid?  Is Orbital punching sequences in and out & changing themix without touching a keyboard valid?  Is a DJ spinning records on two<br>1200s valid?  Are they somehow less valid than a Bluegrass band because<br>most or all of the material is prerecorded?<br><br>>I've seen Vapourspace do PA's three times now.  Every performance was<br>>completely different -- not because he did a silly dance or played air<br>>guitar, but because he he fed off the energy of the dancers, tweaking<br>>sounds and sequences in response to what he was creating and what the<br>>audience was giving back to him.  Mark Gage is a bespectacled funny<br>>looking geek -- no one was standing looking at him because &#34;it's the<br>>concert thing to do&#34; -- rather people were orgiastically humping<br>>speakers, staring into the lights as their tabs kicked in, whatever:<br>>because he was able to accurately engage the vibe and respond to it.<br><br>Yes - this is the way it should be.  I went to see Autechre in Seattle,<br>where everyone, except myself & possibly one other person, were standingaround gawking at the &#34;band&#34; punch in tracks on their R8 move mixer faders,tweak synths, and the usual techno boffin antics.  They stormed off stageafter 20 minutes, presumably because only two people were dancing.  Thisleads to my second question, which is:<br><br>Is there REALLY a need to have people on a stage?  Couldn't they just aseasily be located in the DJ booth?  I feel that if we removed the visualfocus presented by having performers on a stage, the audience will focusmore on 1) each other and how everyone is connected and 2) the music andhow it is affecting them.<br><br>>mr. i read the crosspost and there isn't a damn inch of bandwidth on<br>>playing live vs playing dat.<br><br>Well, I feel like the shift in musical tastes are intimately connected w/the imminent shift in the performer/artist relationship.

Every generation likes to think that <br>they've created some kind of revolution.  I'm 33 and I welcome most of <br>the new dance/techno sounds because they're a little different, and I've been searching for different things for my whole music-listening life, <br>as far as I can remember.  Most rock and roll seems kind of tired, but <br>the thing that is most surprising to me is that it still attracts so <br>many young people who think they're into something new when they tune in MTV &#34;alternative music.&#34;  But postpunk dance sounds are so old, too, <br>that no one can really claim this as some baffling new music for young <br>people.  Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire and The Residents created  innovative techno in the the mid-to-late '70s.  I don't have to remind people on this list about what Eno, Kraftwerk, etc. were doing in the early <br>'70s.  Postpunk of the late '70s was also the source of rare vinyl <br>culture.  Meanwhile, disco contributed to much of this &#34;dance music <br>revolution&#34; over 20 years ago.  Never mind disco, what about rap?  Rap <br>music was being played in my hometown, The Bronx, as far back as 1974.  So what's so new?  What's the revolution?  What it is it, supposedly, <br>about these new dance sounds that alienates everyone over 25?<br><br>I'm not a big rap fan, but I know there's nothing so new about <br>listening to techno.  Good techno moves people the same way any music <br>does, through movement and emotion.  I never thought of it as a big step to accept this music.    <br><br>What's really eye-opening to me in this day and age is the influence of world music.  The most interesting phenomenon today is the blending of <br>western dance music with tribal world music.

Kim<br>Cascone's quest for a new metaphysics... &#34; and instead said &#34;... Terre<br>Thaemlitz' quest for a new metaphysics... &#34;   :|<br><br>actually, Tetsu and I had quite a bit of fun.... but nothing was really<br>mindbending. it was kinda a relief to be in a non-TK crowd<br>(TK=TechnoKid[TM]), though. Tetsu was impressed by the adult-art-scene<br>crowd, but I was cringing.<br><br>I (and everyone I spoke with) thought FSoL was still suffering from<br>over-rambuncious tinkering on gobs of equipment, as opposed to deliveringthe honed-down, sugar-free pure sound they always talk about. the vids inNYC sucked... mostly still shots of FSoL album covers mixed in with bad<br>home-grown video effects. One disturbing thing was that the NY people keptputting the camera on a turtle being fried under intense light. It was<br>really sad. Every now and then they would mix in parts of the FSoL video,but since they had shown it prior to the FSoL broadcast, they didn't playit all the way through again. this was annoying, but I was also glad to bespared images of the little FSoL witch girl! Overall, though, I think theirbroadcast was successful in turning the audience's attention away from the&#34;is it live?&#34; syndrome. By the time Tetsu and I went on there were not<br>people lurking over us, and people seemed quite content to listen and enjoythe event, as opposed to being concerned with &#34;witnessing the creative<br>process&#34; or whatever concertgoers do. For me, this was the key issue behindthe FSoL broadcast, so although I wasn't that turned on by the music, it&#34;worked&#34; quite well.<br><br>Tetsu and I did sets on both Friday and Saturday. Both sets were beatless,but Friday's set was more eclectic and noise based. Someone was complainingto my roommate (unknowingly) that we were soulless, there was never any<br>beat, and she couldn't even imagine anything to the sounds we were<br>creating.  Cool!  :)   Then there was the art-conservator couple in theirlate forties lurking over us. The guy in a blazer exclaims &#34;I just don'tsee what the big deal is! where are their instruments?!&#34; And his wife says&#34;Oh, the turntables are his instruments!&#34;<br>&#34;No!&#34;<br>&#34;Yes! It's an art form!&#34;<br>&#34;But I can't tell what sound that record is making!&#34;<br>&#34;I know! He puts them on and off and you never know! I've never seen<br>anything like it!&#34;<br>blah, blah, blah....  :P  ;)<br><br>The first half of Saturday's set was more mellow, and we played some stufffrom Ambiant Otaku as well as Bill L. & my upcoming album. After a half<br>hour, one of the Kitchen people came up and handed me a microphone and saidI would have to talk (as tetsu &#34;shy-boy&#34; inoue consciously took two stepsbackwards). It was a little confusing to get things lined up w/CA, and Iwish the crowds in both places didn't have to hear us saying, &#34;can you hearour audio? blah, blah, blah.&#34; It was stupid, but the art-people thought itwas a good way to let the crowd know we were linked to CA. I'm afraid I<br>didn't hear any CA IDM'ers, and the only video I saw looked like there wereonly about 10 people in CA. how many were there? I also didn't like the waythe NY camera was pointing in a way that seemed to only show me and not<br>tetsu (although he didn't mind), or the NY crowd. The elementary-school<br>style turntables CA saw were for Christian's performance after us. we wereonly using 2 turntables, DAT, 2 CD's, 16second sampling effect unit, a<br>4-track running loops, and an effect unit. CA's audio signal was droppingin and out, so much of the NY sound was still just Tetsu and I, although wethink CA was continually getting our signal. We did occasionally get somewicked didge from CA, though.  :)  We were mostly playing a-tonal noise,since we knew the CA people were going to be doing chord-progression synthstuff and we didn't want to mix them up too bad in CA since we couldn't<br>always hear what they were doing. Also, around this time I looked over andsome guy was standing there with one of my cd's in his hands, reading thebooklet! And when I asked him, &#34;Could you do that later?&#34; (okay, I was alittle distracted trying to mix and wasn't able to simply tell the guy tofuck off), he got all pissey and said &#34;Fine, then can I at least write downthe record label?&#34;  &#34;yeah, uh, whatever.&#34; really weird.<br><br>overall _fun_, a GREAT space for such events in NYC!!!!

There is that dynamic to work with/within. The feeling of beingon the edge ready to fall on their face(s) and then pulling it off which, ifdone well, is excellent AND exciting to watch. Having pre-recorded music onstage (or in a booth or whatever) is cool (IMO) ONLY if the &#34;player(s)&#34; aredoing something over it (and not just singing over it). A good example of thiswould be Nine Inch Nails who on their first tour went out with a 4-track ofpre-recorded stuff and played WITH IT allowing them the freedom to be livewithout compromising the original concept. It does limit one (time wise). Whatif people are really into something and it's prerecorded? It ends, that's what.If you are live, you can extend and work off of the crowd while they work offof you. DJ's know this, so they mix live. I think alot of this discussionhas been based on the &#34;wanking rockstar dinosaur theory&#34; as in who needs to seethat? ; ) There are pros and cons to each side. Totally pre-recorded shows IMOare worthless. If that is what you are presenting, then why not record it andsell it as an alternate version on CD? Totally live stuff is fine, but admit itthere are certain things that you may not be able to create live. That's whereDAT, etc... comes in. Be open people, everything can be an instrument.

Let me also point out that the originalpost cites the new dance music as being free of melody and harmony. Well, musicconsists of melody and harmony, yes, but it also consists of rhythmic aspectsas well. Drums (whether live or sampled) are tuned to pitch, if you want to getinto technical wanking. So melody does exist in dance. Besides, this is<br>probably the wrong list to post to since many of us hear &#34;music&#34; in crashingwaves or water droplets as well as in a detuned piano or treated guitar.As Bowie once sang, &#34;same old thing in brand new drag&#34;.

Went and stayed later on<br>Friday, eariler on both ends Saturday. I had a much better time<br>on Friday!!<br><br>The highlights for me were the Soldier String Quartet - amazing<br>&#34;drone&#34; stuff to just absolutly lose oneself in, and then DJ<br>Spooky. I am fairly new to music created by DJs, and I started<br>off on Spooky's set on Friday night thinking...&#34;So what's so<br>impressive...&#34; SHit, he showed what was impressive. Spooky was<br>the equal or better to the String Quartet. I totally tranced out<br>on his music - it just went on and on and on...and sadly the<br>crowd filtered out rather quickly - but he spun an amazing about<br>2 hours or more set of almost totally beat-less combinations. I<br>was prettyt zonked out on the couch for a while.<br><br>The layout was impressive. The Kitchen is a really nice<br>space. Two great black-box type theaters. The lower floor was the<br>live acts, upper floor was more DJs spinning. Both floors had<br>projections on &#34;Walls&#34; BIG projections of the video or the video<br>hookups, etc. Upstairs was more mellow and laid back as there was<br>no &#34;stage&#34; pursay. Fairly innocuous - could have totally missed<br>the DJ setup on the side if you didn't look for it.<br><br>Also on the lower floor they had a &#34;scrim&#34; (sp?) covering the<br>stage, which allowed projections in front of the preformers.<br><br>Saturday was disappointing. I probably should have stayed later<br>and listened to the DJs upstairs, but my friend wanted to<br>leave. Cypher-7 was too new-agey for me. Very little groves or<br>anything of the sort going on. Future SOund of London was better<br>&#34;sounding&#34;, but lacked any kind of coherence. Same problems I<br>have with the Lifeform album - lots of dodling that don't hold my<br>attention. I'm not talking dancefloor - I mean some sort of<br>groove or continuancy that links the entire thing together in<br>some feasible way. A few segments (say 10 mins at a time) did<br>have this, but not enough. ALso, it would have been nice if there<br>would have been a little mini-box in the corner of the screen<br>showing the fellows playing with their equiptment - just so that<br>there was a little sense that it was &#34;live.&#34;<br><br>As Terre said, the video on Friday was absolutly horrible! The<br>poor turtle had to endure the frying on Friday too. It would have<br>been cool just to play the Lifeforms video single at least once<br>through. That would have been interesting, but the juxtaposition<br>of ay disimilar computer graphics, turtle and goldfish fry,<br>random stuff, and FSoL video was ultimatly distracting and took<br>away from the music. I did enjoy the parts that had snippets of<br>Liz Frasier...was that from the Lifeforms single?<br><br>The video backing the SOldier String Quartet was more interesting<br>in that it was continuous - some anthropological video of<br>plantain or rice farming??<br><br>Anyways, I now know to go see Spooky perform again!<br>Last dismay - no Laswell as was originally advertised?

I think the range of<br>things presented all shed interesting light on each other, not to mentionthe fact that widely divergent audiences were brought together as well.

A choir of angels singing inside a huge clock tower...<br>A hearty agreement from me with this assessment of<br>Louis Andriessen -- and for his &#34;De Tijd&#34;!   For those<br>even mildly interested in it, check your local clearance<br>and used CD bins.  I got mine for $3, and have seen it<br>for similar prices since.  It's worth much much more than<br>that.  New Albion has a recording by the California EAR<br>Project which includes a substantial Andriessen piece<br>(called &#34;Hoketus,&#34; if memory serves) which is another<br>clanking orchestral piece that owes much to the more<br>droning aspects of minimalism.

Following suggestions from various netters, it now boasts some funky new sections that allow for even more information;<br><br>OTHER RELEASES<br>  This section covers releases not covered by the 'general release' section  and is intended to cover promos, limited editions, R&S/Apollo 2x12&#34;<br>  packs, and anything else that is unusual/collectable/downright sexy.<br><br>REVIEWS<br>  One criticism of discographies is that the listings hold no clues as to  whether the releases are actually any good or not. The REVIEWS section   changes this by supplying small five-line (approx.) reviews which will   hopefully give an indication as to the quality of a release. This section   could conceivably grow to be bigger than the discography itself but what   the heck, eh? As it grows, it will probably be shunted to end of the <br>  discography.<br><br>ARTIST LIST<br>  This contains some brief information (where known) about Apollo artists.  As with the REVIEWS section it is hard to know where to draw the line<br>  between brief artists details and a full discography for each artist.<br>  As a rule, there will be a brief description and then a listing of Apollo  releases for each artist. If you want to know of any more of their <br>  material on other labels, I suggest you search for their discographys<br>  elsewhere. You could even compile your own :-)<br><br>Feedback on these changes would be greatly appreciated as while they're<br>fun to compile, I can see how they are not actually that useful. The <br>reviews especially are likely to differ from person to person and so couldwell be a complete waste of time, depending on your point of view.<br><br>Anyway, if you have any mini-reviews, more artist information or more<br>importantly, discography additions/modifications, please let me know<br>through one of the contax at the end of this file.<br><br>Right, the discography starts below. Have fun kids!<br><br>  Hugs n'kisses,<br>  <br>  AMB 49CiM  <br>  <br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------1.2 INTRODUCTION : A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO APOLLO<br><br>The Apollo label is the ambient division of R&S Records based in Belguim.Whilst it has artists who only release on the Apollo label (e.g. Biosphere)it also features releases from R&S artists issuing ambient LP/12&#34;/EP's<br>(e.g. Robert Leiner, Ken Ishii, etc).<br><br>Because of this link to the techno material available on R&S, the generalstyle of Apollo releases tends to be ambient-techno. Many releases have<br>beats (usually with low BPMs) instead of tending to the beatless and moreminimal forms of ambient music.<br><br>Apollo 12&#34; releases have a catalogue number in the form of APOLLO <number>.Album catalogue numbers currently take the form AMB <number> LP/CD/MC/..The <number> for albums is usually in the form 39xx (where xx is the issuenumber) or for more recent issues, 49xx. Like R&S catalogue numbers, thisreflects the year (eg. AMB 39xx is for the year 1993, AMB 49xx for 1994,etc).<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------2.

DISCOGRAPHY<br><br>The discography will attempt to be in order of catalogue number. As a rule,the catalogue numbers follow each other chronologically, although this<br>isn't always the case (eg. the Apollo Compilation). Each release will<br>contain the following information;<br><br>Cat. no : The catalogue number of the release.<br>Artist  : The name of the artist/act for this release. This could well be          an alias for an artist who might release material under a <br>          number of different names.<br>Release : The name of the album/12&#34;/EP released.<br>Format  : The media that the release was issued on (usually vinyl, compact          disc and occasionally cassette).<br>Tracks  : The list of tracks appearing on the release. Where available,<br>          track playing times and remix names are given.<br>Notes   : Any relevent information about the artist or release. In some<br>          cases this has been expanded on in the 'Artist list' section at          the end of the discography.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------4.1 Apollo : 12&#34;/EP Releases<br><br>This includes all 12&#34; releases in Belgium only or in Europe on general<br>release.

REVIEWS<br><br>This section contains some brief opinions about some Apollo releases andwill hopefully give you an idea about what to buy and what to avoid. Bearin mind this is all in the reviewer's opinion only! Flow your reviews <br>(maximum 6 lines only, please) to u9323899@sys.uea.ac.uk in the format/<br>style as shown below and if they're any good, in they go!<br>Stick your name/net alias after the review if you wish. Ideally your reviews will be on releases not already listed below, but if you violently disagree with any existing ones, send those too.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------APOLLO 8<br>Ken Ishii : Deep Sleep<br>  Many find Ishii's electronica awkward to listen to; this however is a   polished release. Strange electronic loops burble over lush chords and   make it a refreshingly different Apollo release. <CiM><br><br>APOLLO 12<br>Biosphere : Seti Project<br>  More trademark metallic darkness from Geir Jensenn. Worth checking out  for the superior remix of &#34;The Fairy Tale&#34;. The title track, whilst hardly  being ambient, is dark, fast and very tasty indeed. <CiM><br><br>AMB 926<br>[Various] : Apollo Compilation<br>  An excellent compilation showcasing early Apollo material. Highlights<br>  are the analogue tweakery of Atlantis' &#34;Paradise&#34; and the lush dreaminess  of the David Morley tracks. The Orb remix is a bit disappointing<br>  though, IMHO of course. <CiM><br><br>AMB 3921<br>Biosphere : Microgravity<br>  Although not as polished as Patashnik, Microgravity still maintains<br>  Jensenns unsettling ambient-techno. &#34;Baby Interphase&#34; is a clattering   trance number where as &#34;Biosphere&#34; is just downright scary. <CiM><br><br>AMB 3922<br>Aphex Twin : Selected Ambient Works 85-92<br>  Although vastly dissimilar to Selected Ambient Works Vol.2, this album  is also totally brilliant. Richard James covers all areas here with <br>  beatless ambience (&#34;i&#34;), airy techno (&#34;Pulsewidth&#34;) and even ventures   into the world of dub (&#34;We Are The Music Makers&#34;). There are a few<br>  filler tracks here but most of it is James at his best and most<br>  accessible. <CiM><br><br>AMB 3929<br>Locust : Weathered Well<br>  Scary, deep ambience from Locust; it's accomplished but unsettling stuff.   Aphex comparisons abound with drifting synth sounds and some nasty<br>  metallic beats but it has a menacing atmosphere to it. Impressive but<br>  don't buy this if you like your ambience cheerful. <CiM><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------6. ARTIST LIST<br><br>This contains some brief information (where known) about some Apollo<br>artists.<br><br>APHEX TWIN<br>The Aphex Twin is Richard D. James from Cornwall, England. Richard has <br>recorded under many aliases (AFX, Polygon Window, The Caustic Window, etc)but the Aphex Twin is his most familiar pseudonym. &#34;Selected Ambient Works85-92&#34; was released following a number of R&S releases (&#34;Analogue<br>Bubblebath Vol.1&#34; and &#34;Xylem Tube EP&#34;). The Aphex Twin has now signed toWarp Records but still releases material on his own RePhleX label.<br>  Apollo releases:<br>  - AMB 3922  : Selected Ambient Works 85-92 [LP]<br><br>BIOSPHERE<br>Biosphere is Geir Jenssen from Tromsoe, Norway.

Kirk and Stephen Mallinder, although mostof the input for &#34;The Conversation&#34; LP was provided by Richard. Cabaret<br>Voltaire have an extensive background as part of the early<br>industrial/electronic scene but &#34;The Conversation&#34; signals a different<br>direction; similar to the material that Richard H. Kirk is releasing<br>as solo projects. Richard has released his &#34;Virtual States&#34; album on Warprecently as well as recording under the alias of Sandoz.<br>  Apollo releases:<br>  - AMB 4934  : The Conversation [LP]<br><br>THE FIRES OF ORK<br>The Fires Of Ork are Geir Jenssen (Biosphere) and Pete Namlook, owner of acclaimed electronic label Fax +49-69/450464. As well as the 12&#34;, this <br>collaboration also produced an album &#34;The Fires Of Ork&#34; which was released on Fax records as well as on Apollo.<br>  Apollo releases:<br>  - APOLLO 11 : The Fires Of Ork [12&#34;]<br>  - AMB 3928  : The Fires Of Ork [LP]<br><br>THE IRRESISTABLE FORCE<br>Better known as top ambient DJ Mixmaster Morris, The Irresistable Force<br>has released material both on Rising High and with Pete Namlook on<br>Fax +49-69/450464 under the collaboration name of &#34;Dreamfish&#34;.

Apollo releases:<br>  - AMB 3924  : The Irresistable Force [LP]<br><br>ISHII, KEN<br>Ken Ishii is from Tokyo and has released most of his unconventional<br>electronic music on R&S. &#34;Deep Sleep&#34; is (currently) his only release forApollo but he has a retrospective LP on R&S (&#34;Innerelements&#34;) which<br>features selected tracks from his many releases on R&S and also Apollo.<br>His R&S releases include the acclaimed 2x12&#34; pack &#34;Garden Of The Palm&#34;, &#34;Pneuma&#34; and also his new &#34;Tangled Notes&#34; 12&#34;.<br>  Apollo releases:<br>  - APOLLO 8  : Deep Sleep [12&#34;]<br><br>JAM & SPOON<br>Better known for their trancey-pop material, Jam & Spoon curently have abig deal with Epic which resulted in chart success in England and in<br>Europe. Jam El Mar also works with DJ Dag under the name Dance 2 Trance,who also enjoyed chart success with &#34;Power Of American Natives&#34; and <br>&#34;Take A Freefall&#34;.<br>  Apollo releases:<br>  - AMB 3930  : Tripomatic Fairy Tales 2002 [LP]<br><br>LEINER, ROBERT<br>Robert Leiner is an engineer in the R&S studios in Belgium. As well as<br>releasing material under his own name for Apollo, he is probably better<br>known for his R&S produce under the name &#34;Source&#34; (e.g. &#34;Organised Noise&#34;).  Apollo releases:<br>  - APOLLO 9  : Dream Or Reality [12&#34;]<br>  - AMB 3925  : Visions Of The Past [LP]<br><br>LOCUST<br>Locust is Mark Van Hoen from England.

Hell,you can't take producers working on a shoe-string budget and hand them aquarter million dollars and expect them not to change in terms of motivesand outcome. Also, there's alot more contemporary ambient stuff out therenow, and I think that can have a &#34;negative influence&#34; on other producers bycreating stricter definitions of the current ambient genre. The stronger&#34;ambient&#34; becomes, the more a producer has to work in relation to it as anideological and corporate construct - either in acceptance or opposition (iwould say always some of each). But as i've seen with other &#34;underground&#34;movements coopted by the man ;), a market flooded with mediocrity still hasabout as many really fierce albums coming out as a very small and elite<br>&#34;underground&#34; consiting of only one or two mind-altering producers.

Ugh.  <br>I'll be going back into the studio and remixing the entire thing.  Here's the problems as I see them:<br><br>\tThe master tape was recorded over for the first 15 secs.  I'm <br>such a dolt when I'm in a hurry.  I'll be using VCR masters for the next mix.  And then, if I get good feedback, I'll probably be able to switch to DAT in a few weeks.<br><br>\tThe recording levels were messy.  Try setting up a recording <br>level in one room, then running out to the other room and watching air <br>transmission levels.  Then running back and finding that your levels are wrong.  Adjust them, then run back to see the air levels are messy <br>again.  Comic, but doesn't make for a good recording.<br><br>\tThe set itself had very little cohesiveness as far as I'm <br>concerned.  Has some nifty, and goofy tracks.  A beautiful album by JRR Tolkien appeared at random intervals throughout (The Adventures of Tom <br>Bombadil, and A Elbereth Gilthoniel.)  Heheheheh, just to keep things <br>interesting, I even used a bit of the Blue Danube.  <br><br><br>\t<sigh>  Still, I'm not totally dissatisfied.  More than anything, <br>this gave me a good feel for how long 3 hours can really be.  I'm not <br>sure if I'll expand to 4 hours, or just end it at the 3 hour mark.  If I use VCR masters, then the cassette dubs will be a little bit odd, since they'll fade out for a moment, then fade back in when the next tape <br>starts up.  Perhaps, if you all don't mind waiting about another week or so, I'll go in Monday, redo the mix.  Get a better feel for what I want to do, then I'll wait for some DAT tapes and do it that way.  <br><br><br>\t<sigh>  Heheheheh, long and stressful evening, but otherwise a <br>lot of fun.

Heheheh, I DO recycle mailers, so who knows what you'll get.  8-)<br><br>\tThe turnaround time will depend on what I record my mix onto, so <br>expect a couple week delay for people in the states.  The others, well, don't worry, they'll get there eventually, just takes a little longer.  8-)<br>\tThat's it.  Thank you to everyone for hints, suggestions, and the <br>general outpouring of interest.  Heheheh, you all make me feel incredibly self-concious when I'm mixing, which means that I'll try and do my best job possible, above and beyond my normal standards.  8-)<br><br>\tMore stuff:  The recordings will be of the highest quality that I <br>can get here in the studio.  That means that the signal will go from the source, through the mixing board, to tape.  That tape may well be VCR, <br>DAT, or Reel-to-Reel, depending on the Fates.  8-)  However, the vinyl is crackly in some points, so that will show up, but it's to be expected, <br>since I don't have the most wonderful set-up to be imagined.  This studio is our main production room so all of the equipment will be of higher <br>quality than elsewhere, so I'll do my best.<br><br><br>\tAgain, thanks to everyone who is interested in my set.  I've <br>finally gotten my brains together about a general theme for the overall set, so that will help immensely with the programming.  The range of <br>&#34;Ambient&#34; music played will vary.  There is some Orbish Dub, spoken word albums, in brief doses.  Some tweaky space noises, some lovely floaty <br>stuff (Thank you Kim Cascone!) and of course, a bit of the KLF with Chill Out.  ALL of my material, except for Heavenly Music Corp, is essentially older stuff.  This is because of two things:<br>\t1.  I'm in Moscow, Idaho.  Record stores don't stock this stuff, <br>so I really have no local source or no capital to get some.  Any <br>donations will be blessed personally by me!   8-)<br><br>\t2.  I like this music.  That's the main reason I am DJing today.  <br>I enjoy the music I play, and I like all of the pieces I use in my set.  If I don't like the track, I won't use it.  So, although I'm using what some may considered dated (and I don't have any Spiffy Graphics (tm) so Dog will be angry), these are still representative of many different <br>styles, and are lovely.  <br><br><br>\tWell, that's it.

It's about 1% Chapterhouse and 99% Global Communication, in case you were wondering.<br><br>Mike<br><br><br><br>From owner-ambient  Sun Oct  2 01:12:44 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id BAA21065; Sun, 2 Oct 1994 01:12:44 -0700Received: from ftp.std.com by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) with ESMTP id BAA21060; Sun, 2 Oct 1994 01:12:41 -0700Received: from world.std.com by ftp.std.com (8.6.8.1/Spike-8-1.0)<br>\tid EAA13435; Sun, 2 Oct 1994 04:12:43 -0400<br>Received: by world.std.com (5.65c/Spike-2.0)<br>\tid AA09834; Sun, 2 Oct 1994 04:12:44 -0400<br>From: chowe@world.std.com (Chris Howe)<br>Message-Id: <199410020812.AA09834@world.std.com><br>Subject: Re: CAUSING RIPPLES<br>To: dog@neoneo.demon.co.uk (DOG)<br>Date: Sun, 2 Oct 1994 04:12:43 -0400 (EDT)<br>Cc: ambient@hyperreal.com<br>In-Reply-To:  <9410012216.aa05242@post.demon.co.uk> from &#34;DOG&#34; at Oct 1, 94 10:21:23 pmX-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4 PL23]<br>Mime-Version: 1.0<br>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII<br>Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<br>Content-Length: 941       <br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br>> <br>>                   DOG   SAYS<br>> <br>>    i desperatly need to hear something electronic that totally engulfs me<br>> <br>>         RIPS ME APART  AND SPITS ME OUT  SOMETHING ORGANIC<br>> <br>>                         SOMETHING  HARSH  BUT BEAUTIFUL<br>> <br>>                         SOMETHING DISTANT YET STRANGELY CLOSE<br>> <br>>                         SOMETHING LIVING INSIDE<br>> <br>>                 PLEASE  WHERE HAVE YOU ALL GONE ?????????<br>> <br>>                 DOG----<br>>                          in the out house<br>> <br><br>Dog, I don't think we can help you, nor can any type of music, for that matter.

Much of this list of late has been dedicated to (everyone knows this) dog and the &#34;missing&#34; tracks on <br>the AI2 comp.  That's fine:  this is the ambient/intelligent dance forum, and both those threads bore on the subject somehow.  I'm not saying these discussions don't belong here.  However, I am looking for something <br>more.  I've not read anything here yet which creates in me a feeling <br>comparable to that of the best ambient records.  I find many things to <br>criticize in DOG's approach, but bad grammar isn't one of them.  We need new forms, not in music (that's handled nicely with instruments, not <br>mailing lists) but in writing.  Jack Kerouac was influenced by bebop, <br>Lester Bangs by noisy garage rock--what writing will come out of <br>ambient?  Is it possible?  Can you lose yourself in writing the same as in music?  The two are very different forms--losing oneself in music can mean a complete letting go, a surrender of consciousness.  Reading and <br>writing aren't typically such passive pastimes.  I think of someone like Gertrude Stein, where every prase is a complete moment, where we don't <br>read to understand, but to be in the presence of language.  That sort of non-goal oriented freedom might be a good direction for ambient prose.  I think there is a potential to create a lasting, viable art form on this list, a style of writing that might become just as moving, intoxicating, and important as ambient music.

I'm also happy that many<br>>        enjoyed the SF show, which I thought was a pretty cool event ...<br>><br>>        Some people don't like ambient music! Well, that's no suprise.<br>>        Maybe we need to create   alt.flame.ambient? Then people can sound<br>>        off all they want ...<br>><br>>        I'm happy to accept criticism from anyone including DOG.<br>>        But I did feel that this posting was a bit pathological ....<br>>        I mean, when the guy hears something of mine he likes eg Autumn<br>>        Leaves mix, he alleges that I didn't make the record!<br>>        (needless to say, this is COMPLETELY false!!)<br>><br>>        Nonetheless, neither DOG or anyone else should be unsubbed.<br>>        I agree that ambient music needs to evolve and improve - and I<br>>        don't doubt for a second that it will. Like techno this is a<br>>        true underground music that spreads by osmosis - and like techno<br>>        it MUST reinvent itself again and again, like a lizard shedding its<br>>        skin. Like DOG I too am looking for MORE - just like in techno, what<br>>        was great last year is run-of-the-mill nowadays. There is lots of<br>>        music to choose from - a bewildering choice for newbies!<br>><br>><br>>        Ambient music is a broad church. People come to it from different<br>>        directions, with different sets of values, and different expectations<br>><br>>        It's been my immense pleasure & good fortune to play at parties all<br>>        over the world, and to observe reactions & comments. Only a coupla<br>>        years ago, many would be completely freaked out! I remember one<br>>        guy shouting over and over 'The bass bins are blown !! I can't even<br>>        hear the drums!<br>><br>>        Nowadays, every raver & clubber is aware of the chillout room, and<br>>        it's often the busiest and most popular part in the club.<br>>        Different clubs & scenes are deveoping their own chillout styles<br>>        This is a rerun of what happened to Techno here a few years ago ...<br>><br>>        At early UK raves/acid house arties just about every style of house<br>>        & techno & acid got mashed up. THERE WERE NO RULES and there were<br>>        no barriers and consequently the atmosphere was amazing.<br>><br>>        Pretty soon, everything got categorised as garage, jungle, hardcore<br>>        trance, breakbeat, etc. The result - you don't hear any variety<br>>        at all on the dancefloor! Everyone seems to hate everyone else, and<br>>        the UK rave scene is in a sorry state. People from different scenes<br>>        don't even speak to each other ... techno needs to find some unity<br>>        as it's under constant attack from the police / CJB / clubs / media.<br>><br>>        I'm glad that there are dozens of fine ambient DJs all over<br>>        the world, and each has their OWN style! I'll post some biogs<br>>        of the best of the *many* I've seen, like Spacecake, Spooky, Scanner<br>>        Open Mind, Offshore State Circus, Dr Atmo, Tom Pazen, Ambient Daan,<br>>        Tony Morley, Oscillate Sound System, Bruce Gilbert etc<br>><br>>        So if you don't like one, try another. There, that was easy.<br>>        The same goes for records! Why expect to like every ambient record?<br>>        Does anyone like EVERY Rock record? or EVERY techno record?<br>>        No, everyone knows you have to sort the diamonds from the shit<br>         yourself.<br>>        BUT ambient and techno music together represent the most potent force<br>>       in music today, and both are definitely ALIVE.<br>><br>>        If you ask me, it's ROCK MUSIC that's developing rigor mortis ....<br>>        Now that's what *I* call flamebait!!<br>><br>>        Wow, this was meant to be a short note! I've just come back from<br>>        Munich Universe rave (30,000 people) and it's 6 am so i'm off to bed ..<br>><br>>                                        mixmaster morris<br>><br>><br>><br>><br><br><br><br>From owner-ambient  Mon Oct  3 22:58:06 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id WAA08361; Mon, 3 Oct 1994 22:58:06 -0700Received: from netcom9.netcom.com by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) with ESMTP id WAA08356; Mon, 3 Oct 1994 22:58:01 -0700Received: by netcom9.netcom.com (8.6.9/Netcom)<br>\tid WAA14247; Mon, 3 Oct 1994 22:57:31 -0700<br>From: cspot@netcom.com (Chris.Hilker)<br>Message-Id: <199410040557.WAA14247@netcom9.netcom.com><br>Subject: Re: Re(3): FAX - Oops...<br>To: XdadaX@aol.com<br>Date: Mon, 3 Oct 1994 22:57:31 -0700 (PDT)<br>Cc: ambient@hyperreal.com<br>In-Reply-To: <9410031922.tn244560@aol.com> from &#34;XdadaX@aol.com&#34; at Oct 3, 94 07:22:21 pmX-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4 PL23]<br>MIME-Version: 1.0<br>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII<br>Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<br>Content-Length: 747       <br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br>>Actually, the lesson should be DO buy anything by &#34;Silence&#34; (if you like<br>>dark, haunting ambient music) If you like the light and cheery ambient sound<br>>steer clear but for what it is Silence is right up there with the best of the<br>>genre.

Poverty really sucks likethat. Hopefully, I can get something out at less than underunderundergroundsomeday, so it'd be easier for people to get my work, but right now, I'mnot getting any appreciable action from any of the labels I've sent demosto, although I have managed to scratch up a couple live PAs. And the resultsfrom demos sent overseas has been even more discouraging; apparently, thetales of there being an appeal to US releases over in Europe are BS...atleast, perhaps, as far as ambient has been concerned. Still, I also haven'ttried very much with Europe, since I don't know all the circles and <br>structures over there...

First,I wouldn't say they are representative of what FAX is nowadays.  All of these tracks were taken from the early days (Sequential, Limelight, <br>Subsequence, Silence, Putney, Minimalistic Source etc.) where Namlook wasfirst starting to push ambient out by coupling it with dance music.  Muchof this was very samey, which doesn't mean it's not good, but both Namlookand FAX have progressed so much in the past year that FAX does not soundthe same as it would on these compilations.<br><br>Also, I would not buy these records because of the manner in which they<br>came out.  It is well known that Rising High lost the licensing deals<br>with Harthouse Frankfurt and then with FAX, probably over these albums.<br>Rising High supposedly released DAC2 without clearing it with FAX.  RisingHigh may release some good music, but their business practices are very<br>sketchy.  I'm kind of a hypocrite cause I just bought the new Wagon Christ12&#34; (not bad), but I try not to support this label too much.  If you stillwant to hear a good cross-section of what FAX was around a year or two<br>ago I would suggest buying The Definitive Ambient Collection Volume 2: TheArtists Cut, on the Ambient World (FAX sister label) label.  This way youget to hear some good music and you support a worthy label.<br><br>Also, I don't think it does any good to push &#34;Silence&#34; on people.  FAX<br>is definitely for some people and definitely not for others.  If you havea short attention span and get bored quickly most FAX releases will be<br>passed over cause they are very droney and slow.

There was a magazine, <br>called _Ice River_, which focussed on electronic music and speculative <br>fiction as interconnected things.  _Cyber Psycho's A.O.D._ also seems to split its coverage between speculative fiction and reviews of electronic music.

Mosso, however, I would like to take it a step further.Why must we classify music by type of instrument used? The Rolling Stones havea release with Jagger fronting the LSO playing the music of the Stones. So,therefore it must be classical now right? Wrong! It's still pop/rock or whathave you. I understand that ambient may be a forward kind of music and thatelectronics, internet, blah, blah, blah play a major part in the culture ofambient and techno music, however, it is a contradiction to limit oneself tocreating ambient/techno/younameit music strictly with electronics. The musicitself is in the air waiting to be brought into our world through any means,and if that means creating ambient music with piano and human voices (seeMusic for Airports/Eno) or by placing three guitars on stands to feedbackwhile occasionally being manipulated, then so be it. We should not limitourselves as artists or be manipulated by the gear we use (listen back toa lot of the early 80's synth stuff, some of it still holds, but most soundVERY dated and limited as opposed to much of the ENO catalog which in myopinion is timeless because he was able to manipulate whatever gear he had toHIS liking, creating something that, again in my opinion, is difficult to pinpoint timewise on the dateline of the 20th century). Perhaps we should not beso concerned with what instruments are used, but direct our focus to HOW theyare used and applied to a song structure or non-structure.  Perhaps sayingthat rock is dead is a way of describing the intangible feeling one getswhen one hears a I-IV-V progression with the same old guitar sound, the sameold drum sound and the same old eighth note bass line plodding along. Not thatthere is anything wrong with this setup and the occasional use of these<br>dynamics but, COME ON! We have been force fed this kind of thing long enough.Artists (used loosely) that fall into this category (well, not all, but most)are simply playing what they grew up hearing and what they think sounds COOL.If I hear that awful Green Day #%*! one more time (that guitar in their hit isso... retroactive KISS) I'm gonna have a green day all over my shoes. But alasKurt Loder must love them because they are so &#34;punky&#34; (cute, Kurt, cute). &#34;Alas, music what a beautiful artform, but what a wretched profession&#34; --Bizet(I think).<br>So, if we as artists and/or consumers are going to continue promoting this kindof music then it is hopeless. Boy, did I go off on a tangent or what? Just alittle end o' the day anger. &#34;Anger is an energy&#34; --John &#34;not very ambient&#34;Lydon. (I know).<br>So, we must keep ambient alive my friends and more so than ambient, creativity.I truly believe that it is/was the dissatisfaction with music in general (theinundation of pop radio, loud announcers, commercialism) that led to artists(some) moving on and creating what is known as ambient. Sure, I love pop music.The Beatles were a great pop band. Look what they did musically with GeorgeMartin. They DEFINATELY moved forward. DOG will probably call me a &#34;hippywanker&#34; (which he already did in personal e-mail) but alas, I am not a hippy :)(read last line again for bad joke if you didn't get it the first time). Whycan't other bands do this? I received a CMJ disc the other day and it was*@#!ing awful! Every band sounded like this: 180 BPM, plodding bass, poorlyplayed guitar that all sounded the same and some wanking college f*%k<br>screaming something dark and tortured about finding some girl in a river orabout no hope or motivation (see Green Day) or ... who knows or cares! This isthe stuff that used to be considered as novelty a few years back.<br>Sure, I love energy and loud guitars, let's just hear something different fora change ... like 3 guitars on stands running through whatever and creatingHeaven in a club while we lie on the floor. And for the more traditionallyminded, write a song and try to do something creative with your guitar/drums/bass/sampler/oboe PARTS (like the above) underneath your structured pop songand maybe just amaze yourself. I'm trying it. I don't know if I will succeedbut I am trying to create something new and lasting. Aesthetics...what a bitch.<br>Peace, Love and Dog (thanks for the bandwidth, you may delete or save now)TE<br><br>From owner-ambient  Tue Oct  4 20:23:20 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id UAA02884; Tue, 4 Oct 1994 20:23:20 -0700Received: from silver.ucs.indiana.edu by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) with SMTP id UAA02879; Tue, 4 Oct 1994 20:23:18 -0700Message-Id: <199410050323.UAA02879@taz.hyperreal.com><br>Received: by silver.ucs.indiana.edu<br>\t(5.65c+/10jsm) id AA27550; Tue, 4 Oct 1994 22:22:16 -0500<br>From: Brian Hostetler <bhostetl@silver.ucs.indiana.edu><br>Subject: Seefeel WWW<br>To: ambient@hyperreal.com (ambient)<br>Date: Tue, 4 Oct 1994 22:22:16 -0500 (EST)<br>Mime-Version: 1.0<br>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII<br>Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<br>Content-Length: 391       <br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br><br>I appologize for the non-compressed AIFFs of Seefeels new CD5.

No beats to speak of ...<br><br>'Q11' -- floating repeated Juno string figure, accompanying answering<br>machine messages.

And some of that earlier stuff of theirs,like &#34;Tooled Up&#34; from the &#34;Manman&#34; EP (or the &#34;Independency&#34; comp) comesrather close to sounding like techno played on regular rock instruments.

Souster appears on the DGG recording of Karlheinz <br>Stockhausen's &#34;Sternklang&#34; with his own experimental music ensemble, <br>&#34;Intermodulation&#34;, which also recorded some of Souster's own music in the mid-70s. Souster also has been associated with the music experimentationgoing on at the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop during the same period. Judgingfrom the sound of other Wire-related pieces from the period (especially theexperimental works on the EP in the UK version of &#34;154&#34;), I'm more inclinedto think that the heavier influence on Wire, and Gilbert and Lewis <br>especially, was much more related to developments in avant-garde &#34;serious&#34;music than Eno's normally-pervasive influences.<br><br><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\\ &#34;We have come to the edge of a world whichD.A.C.

I see where you are coming from, but you have to look at history a bit to be able to grasp something &#34;underground&#34; surfacing to a <br>&#34;mainstream&#34; crowd.  The ONE area that keeps this and IDM-type stuffs <br>underground is lack of exposure.  If people do not KNOW of choices in <br>music, then they cannot DECIDE to like it.  Exposure is severely <br>lacking.  In the record/tape/CD store I manage, I often get sales SIMPLY from in-store play of items not available via general channels in the US.<br>Humourous Example:<br><br>\tI was playing the new Sabrettes compilation, _Pink Me Up_ (??? - <br>I am so bad about looking at the damn packaging - into the player until out of the player...), and there were two women shopping.  One had to be about 55-65 and the other was early to late forties.  they looked like <br>Wheel of Fortune still ranked as a &#34;high-point&#34; of each day.  the older lady was buying 3 discs, marked WAY WAY down, that were all blues <br>collections.  The younger, buying _Theodore - An alternative Music <br>Sampler_, used, for 5 bux.<br>\tThe older asked what was playing.  As is oft the case, I expected <br>a crack about it being like &#34;Logan's Run music&#34;.  She said &#34;this would be great house-cleaning music&#34; and the younger agreed.  Then she added <br>&#34;well, I couldn't listen to it ALL the time, but when in the mood, it <br>would get me up and moving about&#34; and the younger agreed.  I explained it was import only, Cd only (for brevity...), and fairly hard to get - i.e. expensive.  BUT, I said I could point out similar things of simlar sound and equal to better quality if they wished.<br>\tMind you, they had already paid for their purchases....  I showed <br>them several items in the &#34;techno&#34; bin, proffering InterMix's _Phase ][_, since it was marked down to a cool 9.98.  I said that it was harder in <br>parts, but that it was a mix of many different styles, all in one.  Very upbeat and rather heavily layered.  the older said that if she liked it, she would tape it and pass the disc to the younger.  the younger said <br>&#34;Cool.&#34;  <BFG>  I also said that they could get six bucks trade back if it totaly didn't suit, as it was a guess to test the waters.  They liked that a lot.  (3 bux to give it a whirl?  Not bad, say I and them)<br><br>Now that I related all that (they have not yet returned with an opinion), I say that there are many points to be made with the above.  these women were not involved with either the &#34;mainstream&#34; (much...very little at <br>most) OR the &#34;underground&#34;.  Maybe they have different benefits to be <br>gained from the music, but GAIN is still the important part.  My <br>Grandmother liked The Orb when she chanced hearing it at the Zone (work).(&#34;Mind you, not ALL of the time, but it's kind of neat...different than ANYTHING I've heard, even from YOU&#34; - My GrandMa - the last bit referring to the two years I lived with them after graduation from HighSchoolLand)<br>My grandmother had nary even commented in any direct manner to music I <br>played around her, much less LIKING it and ADMITTING that.  I find this to be utterly cool.  I see no reason to perpetuate an &#34;underground&#34;.  I only wish to perpetuate music- music for all; all being able to find that music which suits them best, no matter what it is or where it comes from or who else listens.  the way I see it, the only TRUE underground ends at the musicians...they have the original vision...we just <br>share/interpret/RE-interpret/pass the stuff on for others or KEEP it to ourselves, selfishly.<br><br>Now that I have said all this, please explain your side once more.  I <br>still can't see the reasoning.<br><br>> I can't think of many ambient tracks in my collection that stand very <br>> steadily under the 8-10min range.  How then could a music industry that <br>> thrives on tracks that mainly sit in the 3-5min range be able to cope <br>> with this type of music without one of the two having to undergo rather <br>> drastic changes.  Broadcasting ambient is problematic enough when taking <br>> into account the loss of quality sustained, even when the time and will <br>> exists to put full length tracks to air.  <br><br>Tracks used to average 2 mins.  WAY back when.  then there was a little further back, where the big bands could swing it up for MUCH longer.  Do not rely upon broadcasting to spread the Gospel of Ambient, at leastm not the radio.  Most of the people I know listen to TALK Radio, never music, and watch some eMpTyVee.  Look more towards the tube for help, THOUGH I SHUDDER TO THINK IT COULD BE A BONUS....  Listen to car commercials. <br>Listen to the bits between the bits on eMpTeeVee...I hear a LOT of cool stuff in the promo spots and on the eMpTeeVee-pRodUcEd-ShtuffS.  It will make it's way forward, slowly but certainly.  Oh yes, it will.  History says so....<br><br>[BTW: time is an issue?  Check how long most classical tracks are...even when broken down into movements...been on the radio and liked by the <br>public for a LONG time...REALLY long time....]<br><br>> The slow, thoughtful develpment of many ambient tracks would have to be <br>> sacrificed to cram then into such a mainstream format, what seems a <br>> highly undesirable prospect.  I'm not against the possibilty of ambient <br>> becoming more widely appreicated (lest our cultural capital loose some of <br>> its value in the face of the mass consumption of our previously highly <br>> guarded secret) but I fear that it would loose out in the face of a music <br>> industry that would attempt to conform ambient to its norms.  <br><br>Norm = the publically/socially accepted standard by which comparison may be made<br><br>Weird = Deviation from the Norm<br><br>Do you disagree?

R. D. James did not compromise for major-label release, which WAS accompanied by some amount of promotion at Warner.  The Orb fought and WON the <br>BigLabelBigPenis War.  I can even cite Nine-Inch Nails.  Not particularly ground-breaking in MUSIC, but VERy path-forging for electronic music.  <br>All a bunch of stepping-stones to the public eye.<br><br>The fact that you consider it a secret baffles me.  What good is <br>knowledge if kept to oneself?  Sharing makes that knowledge double in <br>value, and then exponentially grow from there.  You would rather the <br>public HAD to choose from eMpTeeVee for their music? that's mean, dude.  Real mean.<br><br>I shall continue to perpetuate OPTIONS in music forever.

However, I think thatambient music can be informed by rock instrumentation and sensibilities inthe same sense that it's been greatly influenced by house/techno music sincethe days of Eno. What I've been pointing out is that bands like Seefeel orLabradford can come from a rock perspective, on rock labels (Too Pure,<br>Merge), with rock instruments, and make music that's as ambient as anythingRobert Rich, Aphex Twin or the Orb are putting out.

There's an imaginary DJ running the entire ambient sceneand s/he is producing an awesomely eclectic mix.

He performs many of these albums live, they are <br>nonstop 60 minutes plus fo sounds colaborated into one full lengthy set.<br>Personally i would rather listen to Namlook's actuall beat oriented music ranging from Techno Trance to full on Trance (german style,  check out <br>Vision Sound Carrier's TranceMaster 4:  Tribal Chill Out)  on that <br>particular album Namlook uses the name 4 Voice (maybe because he uses the oberheim 4 voice instrument??  who knows, not i)  his trance music is of the best i have heard.<br><br>I give namlook credit for his ideas and competitive nature.  He puts out many works all by himself and doesnt seem to stop.  to me that is genius, i idleize that for all it means.<br><br>Take Care,<br><br>Ken (Joy)<br><br><br>From owner-ambient  Thu Oct  6 13:25:17 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id NAA15776; Thu, 6 Oct 1994 13:25:17 -0700Received: from alink-gw.apple.com by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) with SMTP id NAA15760; Thu, 6 Oct 1994 13:25:01 -0700Received: from federal-excess.apple.com by alink-gw.apple.com with SMTP (921113.SGI.UNSUPPORTED_PROTOTYPE/7-Oct-1993-eef)\tid AA22213; Thu, 6 Oct 94 13:24:25 -0700<br>\tfor ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Received: from powertalk.apple.com by federal-excess.apple.com with SMTP (5.64/26-Sep-1993-eef)\tid AA19544; Thu, 6 Oct 94 13:23:46 PDT<br>\tfor ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Message-Id: <9410062023.AA19544@federal-excess.apple.com><br>Date: 6 Oct 1994 13:23:55 -0700<br>From: &#34;Jens Alfke&#34; <jens_alfke@powertalk.apple.com><br>Subject: Re: Morris comments on rock<br>To: &#34;ambient@hyperreal.com&#34; <ambient@hyperreal.com><br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br>Joseph Morrison writes:<br>>Just the &#34;smart ones&#34;- those not intimidated by technology beyond pedals <br>>and amps.

Of course we need definition inour life simply for identification purposes. What I was trying to put<br>across was that if we limit our resources within a label (i.e. synths/<br>samplers/Macintosh and no other instrument can only = &#34;techno&#34;), then weare limiting ourselves. Obviously, techno is derived from the word technologywhich as you mentioned = (currently) electronics. Well, an amplifier and aguitar as well as any FX used are electronic. If you manipulate an acousticguitar signal (via sampler and or FX) then it is electronic, no? Keep inmind that a sampler &#34;records&#34; sound to be played back. Many of these sounds arefundamentally organic (from drums to breaking glass to a hammer striking a nail, etc...) and not electronic. So although there is a definate framework suchas pop = strong song structure and ambient = no or very little &#34;song&#34; structureI (for myself) believe that artists should be open to change and use whateverthey want to to put their work across. It is a shame that many do not, probably(and I say this having discussed this very topic with many fellow musicians)for a (subconscious or not) fear of being excluded from a category. &#34;Oh no,so and so used an acoustic guitar over his electronic track, that's not techno!&#34;. I say, open up the flood gates and let the river in. Sure, it's wonderful tohave genres, it helps define what we are and what we like and where to get it,etc... I mean if this list were called Music@hyperreal.com, there might beTony Bennett postings next to Rain, Tree, Crow next to Green Day (sorry,couldn't resist) next to Whitney Houston postings next to talk of FSOL. Notvery productive or interesting. I am just saying that when one works in aparticular type of musical framework, then one should be open to his/hermuse and use what it takes to put across what they are feeling/hearing. Thisis what many so-called ambient artists do anyway, much much less for the technoartists. &#34;Well..., there it is then&#34; (saw Amadeus last night).  My belief isthat the musical ideas, and not the instrumentation, are the chief source ofwhat makes or breaks something as being wonderful or horrible to an individual.<br>Thanks for reading and have a green...

I'm inclined to be a Devil's advocate for many of the discussions as to What is Ambient?  Mostly because, in my <br>experience, ambient is changing heavily, as well as being vague to begin with, as far as a classification is concerned.<br><br>\tIt seems that many groups are starting to use &#34;World Music&#34; a <br>term I hate, because it puts the US and England at the center of the <br>Universe of music.  Heheheh, sort of spooky to think about that.  8-)  <br>Anyway, tracks with bits of vocals from different areas of the world, <br>both sacred chants, and just plain rhythm tracks, seems to be making an interesting influence on Ambient.<br><br>\tPerhaps, it's a rediscovery of the sheer vastness of music that <br>surrounds us.  In my experience, when DJing at parties in Spokane, the <br>ambient room was more focussed towards providing a sonic landscape.  <br>Whether through the use of minimalist works, or Eno-esque tracks (or, my favorite, my $2.99 Rainfall CD, Heheheheh...) the desire to have a <br>continual landscape was evident.  An aside:  Most of the people who <br>seemed to enjoy our sets were on some sort of drug, or were tired from <br>dancing.  Interesting to note that hallucinogens can greatly alter the <br>effects of even the simplest of tracks.  They can become majestic, or <br>terrifying.<br><br>\tOne of our spookiest records we used (Matt Corwine, and I, by the <br>way) was that of a southern Preacher, by the name of Bob Harrington.  To have his hellfire and &#34;Old Time Religion&#34; sermons come floating out of <br>the speakers, especially when heavily processed, was a really dramatic <br>effect.  That, to me, was an interesting ambient set.   Now, the <br>flipside.  I've listened to tracks by a group named Woob.  &#34;World Music&#34; based, they help to transport me to the far reaches of the world, also, they have a lovely beat behind them.  However, it's the overall effect of this track instead of any one element.<br><br>\tAnd so, to finish up my rambling, I beleive that Ambient music <br>just happens.  It doesn't seem to have a definite structure (like a <br>Sonata, or a pop-rock song) but it can be created out of anything.  some of the most involving tracks are nothing more than nature sounds and <br>quiet noises that have been processed.

Later I realized it was two sine waves which wereso close to each other they created a beat wave of about 1 cycle every 10seconds or more. A regular, mysterious, soothing sound I like to fall asleepwith at almost sub-audible levels. It had components in a relatively widefrequency spectrum, but it was not white noise.

Can ambient have a beat? In my opinion the two are hard to combine andstill say you have ambient. If you ask me, ambient is something without aregular beat. Isn't that what sort of defines it? I mean, have a listen to theearly Eno stuff, which is after all where the definition came from... Ambientis supposed to be UNpredictable in a very subtle way. That's what attracts me.That's what allows me to listen to it over and over again. But something with abeat? Isn't that too predictable? I mean, you can call it trance, or ethereal(and I'm not saying I won't like it!) but not ambient. The only cut I've everheard so far which could be classified as being almost ambient and trancy (beatoriented) at the same time is Klaus Schulze's &#34;Life in Ecstasy&#34; on the KSSilver Edition 10 CD set. What a cut! Simply amazing. A seemingly regular beatwhich is impossible to tie down. But in a subtle way! It just blows me away. Ican't be listening to it and doing something else at the same time. It DEMANDSattention.<br><br>Number 2<br><br>Can we say that a whole BUNCH of things can be classified as being ambient?My own thoughts are that ambient is something particular, into which you justcannot cram a whole pile of other things so that the record companies can say:&#34;Aha. Yesterday it was indie, today's flavour is Ambient. Let's start makingsections in all of the record stores and cram all kinds of stuff into thiscategory!&#34; Seriously though.

The ambient writing I'd like to see would not be written in response to music, but derived/distilled/extracted from the same im/pulse as music (assuming they ever share a common source).  Of course, once born, it may diverge so severely from its musical counterpart as to be unrecognizable as &#34;ambient&#34; but that's another matter...<br><br>2.  Although I admit that I don't have a definition of ambient prose yet, and realizing that I alone don't have the right or desire to define it, I must disagree with several of the proposed ambient authors.  Joyce and <br>Cortozar are IMHO anti-ambient writers.  Joyce, esp in Finnegans Wake, <br>constructs massive, culture-wide, deeply personal puzzles which require tremendous effort to approach.  To be sure, I can read his more difficult writing simply to enjoy the sound and beauty of his prose, but secretly I feel a little cheated that I don't &#34;get it.&#34;  Intellectual and ambient <br>don't often sit well together (although Edith Sitwell is at times <br>ambient--see I Was Born Under a Black Sun).  Of the modernists (while <br>we're there), I would choose Virginia Woolf (everything after Jacob's <br>Room), H.D., and the Quentin section of The Sound and the Fury to start with.  Also, much of what the French Surrealists started/produced in the 20s and 30s could be termed ambient--see esp. Nadja by Andre Breton, The Stone Door by Leonora Carrington, poetry of Paul Eluard, the dream <br>narratives of Robert Desnos, and much much more.  (Please, though, don't say &#34;Surrrealism--oh, yeah, like Salvador Dali?).  If you don't know who I'm talking about here, an excellent point of departure is The <br>Autobiography of Surrealism by Marcel Jean.  <br>Of course, I don't want to squelch discussion by forcing my own authorial and stylistic biases on eveyone, so please continue...<br><br>3.  And, finally, what I really want to see now are writers actively <br>writing with ambient music as it is being produced *today*.  i'm looking towards the future more than the past...Towards a writing that could <br>suspend layer upon layer of ambient experience without coming off as a <br>puzzle but rather as a sensual moment.  <br><br>4.

I wouldn't call anything on the album entirely ambient, but (a) it'smoved quite a bit in that direction from the punk-rock/no-wave scene fromwhich they sprang; and (b) -- and this is the biggie -- it's been a hugeinfluence on a number of groups that are extrapolating from Sonic Youth'sguitar textures into purely ambient realms, such as Seefeel, Labradford andLovesliescrushing. Not to mention the ambient aspects of My Bloody Valentine.In the sense of helping to define a sound, SY have contributed as much toambient music as have Tangerine Dream or Richie Hawtin.<br><br>Throbbing Gristle -- did a number of proto-ambient pieces, such as side 2 ofthe 2nd Annual Report, which is all one long track where bits of symphonicmusic fade in and out of other tape collages and drones. Some parts of<br>&#34;Heathen Earth&#34; are also quite ambient. And again, TG were an immense<br>influence on industrial and experimental music of all kinds; not to mentionthat the ex-members of the band went on, in the guise of Psychic TV, Coil andChris & Cosey, to help invent acid house and techno music.<br><br>Jens Alfke ........

'an<br>ending (ascent)' is absolutely beautiful.<br><br>3. tales of the ephidrena - amorphous androgynous<br>yes it may have a beat, but that doesn't mean it is without<br>an atmosphere. this one totally engulfs me.<br><br>4. u.f.orb - the orb<br>sure, this is on everyone's top 10 list, but i have to put<br>it on mine as well. a combination of ambience, house, and<br>dub that is absolutely brilliant.<br><br>5. sheet one - plastikman<br>i have to agree with dave here...i feel this album is somewhat<br>ambient. perhaps ambient acid house...? regardless, i don't<br>feel that having a dance factor means something is without an<br>enviromental feel to it.<br><br>6. 'hymn.alt.quiet.version' - moby<br>a 30+ minute long track of strange atmospheres which are very<br>dark and evil. some parts are pure noise! say what you want<br>about moby, but he has proven he can do a SAW 2.<br><br>7. 'selected ambient works 2' - aphex twin<br>another album everyone will put in their list, but no matter<br>how hard i try to write off this album, the more i get into<br>it! minimal ambience, i really prefer the darker stuff on here.<br>and, yeah, i do know that most of it is a bad copy of eno and<br>the rest!<br><br>8. 'phaedra' - tangerine dream<br>after a few tangerine dream lp's that weren't very good (imo)<br>i tried this one...i'm glad i did. spacey, trancey and with<br>such a moving force i feel like i'm being sucked into a black<br>hole.<br><br>and a few that i thought i'd include to get people upset...<br><br>9. 'warpdrive' - dj crystl<br>yes, this may be a hardcore drum & bass track, but it works!<br>cut up drums that hit all around building and building with a<br>tension and energy and then exploding with a synth line...<br>ambient music is all about creating an enviroment to me, and<br>i feel this track is how an actual warpdrive must feel!<br>ok, so i've watched too much star trek, but really...put this<br>on while watching the 1st one (i think) when they go into the<br>warp...<br><br>10.

It's all written and produced by <br>Richard Nathans, so if anyone knows anything about him or CC I'd be <br>really interested.  <br><br>g.<br><br>[and, for the ambient 'listening list' I'm listening to that Cd right now...]<br>From ambient-owner  Sat Oct  8 03:33:47 1994<br>Return-Path: owner-ambient<br>Received: by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) id DAA04302; Sat, 8 Oct 1994 03:33:47 -0700Received: from mail02.prod.aol.net by taz.hyperreal.com (8.6.9/8.6.5) with SMTP id DAA04292; Sat, 8 Oct 1994 03:33:37 -0700From: PaulT23@aol.com<br>Received: by mail02.prod.aol.net<br>\t(1.38.193.5/16.2) id AA14681; Sat, 8 Oct 1994 06:15:09 -0400<br>X-Mailer: America Online Mailer<br>Message-Id: <9410080615.tn130055@aol.com><br>To: ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Date: Sat, 08 Oct 94 06:15:08 EDT<br>Subject: Ambient History/DOG vs Ambient<br>Sender: owner-ambient@hyperreal.com<br>Precedence: bulk<br>Status: OR<br><br>A.

Pan a group fader to the Left channel master stereo output <br>2. Pan a group fader to the Right channel master stereo output<br>3. Pan a group fader to both Left and Right master stereo outs <br><br>and now the tricky part...<br><br>4. Pan a fourth group fader to mid position, assign its left channel output   to the input of group #1 above and assign the right channel output of    this fourth group to an unused input channel. Set input channel phase    switch to &#34;reverse&#34;. Using this channels &#34;direct channel output&#34; - <br>   route the now phase inverted signal back to the input of group #2 above.<br>OK, so what this describes is a four-to-two matrix scheme with four input busses that we can call: Left, Center, Right and Surround. <br><br>Left buss is assigned to Lt. Center buss is assigned to both Lt and Rt. Right buss is assigned to Rt. Surround buss is assigned to both Lt (in <br>phase) and Rt (phase reversed). <br><br>Now, when you do a mix you can pan signal to any of those busses and they will be encoded in a way that a Dolby Pro-logic surround decoder will <br>respond to.<br><br>I should add that you should hang a Dolby Pro-logic decoder on the Lt/Rt master stereo output and set up a Left, Center, Right, Surround <br>loudspeaker monitoring environment. All matrix surround sound film mixes are monitored this way - while listening to the decoding process in real time - effectively placeing the mixdown engineer in the encode/decode feedback loop. <br><br>For those of you who are real familiar with the Dolby encoding process <br>you'll notice that I didn't describe the surround algorithm as &#34;plus 90 degree left, minus 90 degree right&#34;. As long as you actually monitor your mix in real time with a Pro-logic decoder - and make your mixing <br>decisions based on what you want to hear - the minus 180 degree to right technique I describe will work well. (Besides, you don't _really_ want to know what's involved in designing an all pass +90/-90 phase shifter!)<br><br>An interesting and even cheaper version of the encode/decode scheme I <br>described doesn't even use a full surround loudspeaker set up...check <br>this out...<br><br>You will need near feild monitors that have excellent imaging and that <br>are installed well away from the back and side walls to minimize <br>image-smearing reflection.<br><br>Get a hold of a good laser disc or VHS tape that is surround encoded. Wim Wenders &#34;Wings of Desire&#34; is a solid choice for ambient fans. Play the <br>movie soundtrack through your near feild set up and sit at the apex of <br>the equilateral triangle between your speakers. You will be training your hears to hear what a surround sound mix sounds like when &#34;collapsed&#34; into a two-channel monitoring environment.<br><br>With good loudspeakers, positioned as I've described you will hear <br>surround effects and music appear to image away from the loudspeakers and in some cases come close to sitting just outside your shoulders. Another way to train your ears this way is to first hear a surround sound mix on a well calibrated home theatre system and then play the same mix in the two channel mode. Soon you will be able to translate, in your head, what a mix produced in one environment will sound like in the other.<br><br>The goal here is for you to be able to sit down at a normal two channel near feild monitoring evvironment, configure the board as I've described at the start of the post and create a surround sound ambient mix that <br>will sound way cool over two speakers or a full Pro-logic setup.<br><br>Don't be intimidated by Dolby or other manufacturers attempts to control and limit access to the enocding process.

If you think open-ended synth jams with dubbass drifting in and out occasionally is boring, this record will bore you.I for one rather like the form.

While his STC records mightbe described as having a West Coast vibe, the work on Visitation is verydark.   He does what he does best on this record, which is to build up layersof sounds that subtly interact.  Compared to this record, though, his recent&#34;Sea Biscuit&#34; long player is downright poppy.<br><br>The first cut &#34;Zurvan Akarana&#34; has beats, but not much in the way of<br>recognizable drum tracks.

I've not quite decided what<br>to  think of Laswell's playing -- either there's nothing to it, or he's amaster at understatement.<br><br>The second cut &#34;Aion&#34; is beatless, and is almost entirely Sharp.

About 19 minutes<br>in some hissy percussion kicks in but it seems disconnected from the musicalparts.  This is an odd sort of ambience.  If you give it your full attention,you won't be bored; the constant shifts in texture will hold your attention.If you use it as sonic wallpaper, it will creep you out.  This is not blissmusic.<br><br>So what's my verdict?  I give it thumbs up, primarily because it's an extendedouting  for Mr. Sharp at his most experimental.

It seems a little<br>>    farfetched, but I wouldn't count it out. Hey, if 187 can pass....<br>>    (Californians only. No need for flames...I claim political ignorance.)<br>>    But presumably they wouldn't expect to be winning any popularity contests<br>>    by passing such an act. The CJB et al are definitely government-agenda...<br>>    no PR factors at all...so I doubt preventative complaining will have<br>>    much of an impact.<br>That's what the post suggests, but I seriously doubt it.  The political climate in the UK is extremely different than that of the US, and it'll be a LONG time before such blatant violations of civil liberties are <br>legislated in the US.  With regards to the specific anti-rave provisions, one must remember that the UK Summers of Love were the largest youth <br>movements since the 60's in Britian, and caused a MAJOR uproar among the mainstream community.  Raves were also stealing revenue from pubs, as <br>millions went to them every weekend.<br><br>In the US, rave culture is a bit more underground, a lot more low-key, <br>and generally unobtrusive upon the general public.  Raves are dealt with using existing provisions, the most prominent of them being trespass <br>laws.  I don't foresee the passing of a similar bill in the US.  <br>(Although we have passed the Crime Bill, which is just as damaging in <br>other ways.)<br><br>> 3> The passing of the CJB in the UK implies the passing of a similar law<br>>    that would apply to &#34;Internet gatherings&#34;. The post pretty clearly<br>>    suggests this, and I'll side with the flamers on this one.<br>>    Seeing as the Internet owes its existance in the US to the Defense<br>>    Department, the government would be shooting itself in the foot by<br>>    universally limiting access. Selectively limiting access would be<br>>    pretty serious, though you'd have to get pretty low down in the system<br>>    to do that. But I also claim ignorance of Internet mechanics.<br>I would agree with you on this point.  The notion that the passage of the CJB in England would affect the Internet here is a ludicrous claim with no basis in reality.  Our privacy may be threatened, but I doubt our <br>right to be here will *ever* be threatened.  The Internet is out of <br>anyone's control.<br><br>> <br>> If anyone can clear this up for me, that would be great. Private mail<br>> would be fine, assuming everyone's tired of this.<br>I hope I'm doing my part.
